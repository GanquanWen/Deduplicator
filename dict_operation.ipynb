       " '\\nI: ABOUT THIS TRANSLATION',\n",
       " 'It was with considerable reluctance that I abandoned in favour of the\\npresent undertaking what had long been a favourite project: that of a new\\nedition of Shelton\\'s \"Don Quixote,\" which has now become a somewhat\\nscarce book. There are some--and I confess myself to be one--for whom\\nShelton\\'s racy old version, with all its defects, has a charm that no\\nmodern translation, however skilful or correct, could possess. Shelton\\nhad the inestimable advantage of belonging to the same generation as\\nCervantes; \"Don Quixote\" had to him a vitality that only a contemporary\\ncould feel; it cost him no dramatic effort to see things as Cervantes saw\\nthem; there is no anachronism in his language; he put the Spanish of\\nCervantes into the English of Shakespeare. Shakespeare himself most\\nlikely knew the book; he may have carried it home with him in his\\nsaddle-bags to Stratford on one of his last journeys, and under the\\nmulberry tree at New Place joined hands with a kindred genius in its\\npages.',\n",
       " 'But it was soon made plain to me that to hope for even a moderate\\npopularity for Shelton was vain. His fine old crusted English would, no\\ndoubt, be relished by a minority, but it would be only by a minority. His\\nwarmest admirers must admit that he is not a satisfactory representative\\nof Cervantes. His translation of the First Part was very hastily made and\\nwas never revised by him. It has all the freshness and vigour, but also a\\nfull measure of the faults, of a hasty production. It is often very\\nliteral--barbarously literal frequently--but just as often very loose. He\\nhad evidently a good colloquial knowledge of Spanish, but apparently not\\nmuch more. It never seems to occur to him that the same translation of a\\nword will not suit in every case.',\n",
       " 'It is often said that we have no satisfactory translation of \"Don\\nQuixote.\" To those who are familiar with the original, it savours of\\ntruism or platitude to say so, for in truth there can be no thoroughly\\nsatisfactory translation of \"Don Quixote\" into English or any other\\nlanguage. It is not that the Spanish idioms are so utterly unmanageable,\\nor that the untranslatable words, numerous enough no doubt, are so\\nsuperabundant, but rather that the sententious terseness to which the\\nhumour of the book owes its flavour is peculiar to Spanish, and can at\\nbest be only distantly imitated in any other tongue.',\n",
       " 'The history of our English translations of \"Don Quixote\" is instructive.\\nShelton\\'s, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608,\\nbut not published till 1612. This of course was only the First Part. It\\nhas been asserted that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work of\\nShelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that\\nit has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by \"go,\" about\\nit than the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work\\nof a young man writing currente calamo, and the second that of a\\nmiddle-aged man writing for a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer\\nand more literal, the style is the same, the very same translations, or\\nmistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new\\ntranslator would, by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry\\noff the credit.',\n",
       " 'In 1687 John Phillips, Milton\\'s nephew, produced a \"Don Quixote\" \"made\\nEnglish,\" he says, \"according to the humour of our modern language.\" His\\n\"Quixote\" is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty that\\nfor coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in\\nthe literature of that day.',\n",
       " 'Ned Ward\\'s \"Life and Notable Adventures of Don Quixote, merrily\\ntranslated into Hudibrastic Verse\" (1700), can scarcely be reckoned a\\ntranslation, but it serves to show the light in which \"Don Quixote\" was\\nregarded at the time.',\n",
       " 'A further illustration may be found in the version published in 1712 by\\nPeter Motteux, who had then recently combined tea-dealing with\\nliterature. It is described as \"translated from the original by several\\nhands,\" but if so all Spanish flavour has entirely evaporated under the\\nmanipulation of the several hands. The flavour that it has, on the other\\nhand, is distinctly Franco-cockney. Anyone who compares it carefully with\\nthe original will have little doubt that it is a concoction from Shelton\\nand the French of Filleau de Saint Martin, eked out by borrowings from\\nPhillips, whose mode of treatment it adopts. It is, to be sure, more\\ndecent and decorous, but it treats \"Don Quixote\" in the same fashion as a\\ncomic book that cannot be made too comic.',\n",
       " 'To attempt to improve the humour of \"Don Quixote\" by an infusion of\\ncockney flippancy and facetiousness, as Motteux\\'s operators did, is not\\nmerely an impertinence like larding a sirloin of prize beef, but an\\nabsolute falsification of the spirit of the book, and it is a proof of\\nthe uncritical way in which \"Don Quixote\" is generally read that this\\nworse than worthless translation--worthless as failing to represent,\\nworse than worthless as misrepresenting--should have been favoured as it\\nhas been.',\n",
       " 'It had the effect, however, of bringing out a translation undertaken and\\nexecuted in a very different spirit, that of Charles Jervas, the portrait\\npainter, and friend of Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, and Gay. Jervas has been\\nallowed little credit for his work, indeed it may be said none, for it is\\nknown to the world in general as Jarvis\\'s. It was not published until\\nafter his death, and the printers gave the name according to the current\\npronunciation of the day. It has been the most freely used and the most\\nfreely abused of all the translations. It has seen far more editions than\\nany other, it is admitted on all hands to be by far the most faithful,\\nand yet nobody seems to have a good word to say for it or for its author.\\nJervas no doubt prejudiced readers against himself in his preface, where\\namong many true words about Shelton, Stevens, and Motteux, he rashly and\\nunjustly charges Shelton with having translated not from the Spanish, but\\nfrom the Italian version of Franciosini, which did not appear until ten\\nyears after Shelton\\'s first volume. A suspicion of incompetence, too,\\nseems to have attached to him because he was by profession a painter and\\na mediocre one (though he has given us the best portrait we have of\\nSwift), and this may have been strengthened by Pope\\'s remark that he\\n\"translated \\'Don Quixote\\' without understanding Spanish.\" He has been\\nalso charged with borrowing from Shelton, whom he disparaged. It is true\\nthat in a few difficult or obscure passages he has followed Shelton, and\\ngone astray with him; but for one case of this sort, there are fifty\\nwhere he is right and Shelton wrong. As for Pope\\'s dictum, anyone who\\nexamines Jervas\\'s version carefully, side by side with the original, will\\nsee that he was a sound Spanish scholar, incomparably a better one than\\nShelton, except perhaps in mere colloquial Spanish. He was, in fact, an\\nhonest, faithful, and painstaking translator, and he has left a version\\nwhich, whatever its shortcomings may be, is singularly free from errors\\nand mistranslations.',\n",
       " 'The charge against it is that it is stiff, dry--\"wooden\" in a word,-and\\nno one can deny that there is a foundation for it. But it may be pleaded\\nfor Jervas that a good deal of this rigidity is due to his abhorrence of\\nthe light, flippant, jocose style of his predecessors. He was one of the\\nfew, very few, translators that have shown any apprehension of the\\nunsmiling gravity which is the essence of Quixotic humour; it seemed to\\nhim a crime to bring Cervantes forward smirking and grinning at his own\\ngood things, and to this may be attributed in a great measure the ascetic\\nabstinence from everything savouring of liveliness which is the\\ncharacteristic of his translation. In most modern editions, it should be\\nobserved, his style has been smoothed and smartened, but without any\\nreference to the original Spanish, so that if he has been made to read\\nmore agreeably he has also been robbed of his chief merit of fidelity.',\n",
       " \"Smollett's version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of\\nthese. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas's\\ntranslation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no\\nheed given to the original Spanish.\",\n",
       " 'The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly\\'s,\\nwhich appeared in 1769, \"printed for the Translator,\" was an impudent\\nimposture, being nothing more than Motteux\\'s version with a few of the\\nwords, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot\\'s (1774) was\\nonly an abridgment like Florian\\'s, but not so skilfully executed; and the\\nversion published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother\\'s\\nplates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former\\ntranslations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\\'s, it would be in every\\nsense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not\\neven seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since\\nthen I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the\\ntemptation which Mr. Duffield\\'s reputation and comely volumes hold out to\\nevery lover of Cervantes.',\n",
       " 'From the foregoing history of our translations of \"Don Quixote,\" it will\\nbe seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere\\nnarrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures\\nserved up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether\\nthat form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On\\nthe other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not\\nmerely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least\\nas differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a\\npreference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have\\nacquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.',\n",
       " 'But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there\\nis no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why\\na translator who makes it his aim to treat \"Don Quixote\" with the respect\\ndue to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless\\nreader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a\\nquestion of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with\\nhim who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the\\nSpanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the\\ngreat majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers\\nto whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much\\na part of the translator\\'s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can\\nplease all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those\\nwho look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is\\nin his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is\\npracticable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.',\n",
       " 'My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to\\nindicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my\\nability to follow, in the present instance. One which, it seems to me,\\ncannot be too rigidly followed in translating \"Don Quixote,\" is to avoid\\neverything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in\\none sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than\\nCervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or\\nobsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and\\none for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably\\nundergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in\\nEurope, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of \"Don\\nQuixote\" differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of\\nthe present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote\\'s speeches, the\\ntranslator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will\\nalmost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original.',\n",
       " 'Seeing that the story of \"Don Quixote\" and all its characters and\\nincidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar\\nas household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old\\nfamiliar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of\\ncourse a translator who holds that \"Don Quixote\" should receive the\\ntreatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the\\ninjunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything.',\n",
       " 'II: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE',\n",
       " 'Four generations had laughed over \"Don Quixote\" before it occurred to\\nanyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes\\nSaavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a\\nsatisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of\\nthe author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\\'s instance in\\n1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time\\ndisappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed,\\ntransmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of\\nother record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries\\nwere incurious as to \"the men of the time,\" a reproach against which the\\nnineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no\\nShakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was\\nentrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or\\nNavarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to\\nhimself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence\\nbearing upon his life as they could find.',\n",
       " 'This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good\\npurpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the\\nchief characteristic of Navarrete\\'s work. Besides sifting, testing, and\\nmethodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously\\nbrought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under\\nwhich anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found.\\nNavarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no\\nfault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of\\nShakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: \"It\\nis not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the\\northography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no record\\nof his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a contemporary has\\nbeen produced.\"',\n",
       " \"It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced\\nto make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture,\\nand that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the\\nplace of established fact. All that I propose to do here is to separate\\nwhat is matter of fact from what is matter of conjecture, and leave it to\\nthe reader's judgment to decide whether the data justify the inference or\\nnot.\",\n",
       " 'The men whose names by common consent stand in the front rank of Spanish\\nliterature, Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Quevedo, Calderon, Garcilaso de la\\nVega, the Mendozas, Gongora, were all men of ancient families, and,\\ncuriously, all, except the last, of families that traced their origin to\\nthe same mountain district in the North of Spain. The family of Cervantes\\nis commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably it\\nwas in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I think\\nthe balance of the evidence tends to show that the \"solar,\" the original\\nsite of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of Old\\nCastile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias. As it\\nhappens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the\\ntenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of\\n\"Illustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous\\nNuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\" written in 1648 by the industrious\\ngenealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscript\\ngenealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of John\\nII.',\n",
       " 'The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost as\\ndistinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso\\nVII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, and\\nwas rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo. On\\none of his acquisitions, about two leagues from the city, he built\\nhimself a castle which he called Cervatos, because \"he was lord of the\\nsolar of Cervatos in the Montana,\" as the mountain region extending from\\nthe Basque Provinces to Leon was always called. At his death in battle in\\n1143, the castle passed by his will to his son Alfonso Munio, who, as\\nterritorial or local surnames were then coming into vogue in place of the\\nsimple patronymic, took the additional name of Cervatos. His eldest son\\nPedro succeeded him in the possession of the castle, and followed his\\nexample in adopting the name, an assumption at which the younger son,\\nGonzalo, seems to have taken umbrage.',\n",
       " 'Everyone who has paid even a flying visit to Toledo will remember the\\nruined castle that crowns the hill above the spot where the bridge of\\nAlcantara spans the gorge of the Tagus, and with its broken outline and\\ncrumbling walls makes such an admirable pendant to the square solid\\nAlcazar towering over the city roofs on the opposite side. It was built,\\nor as some say restored, by Alfonso VI shortly after his occupation of\\nToledo in 1085, and called by him San Servando after a Spanish martyr, a\\nname subsequently modified into San Servan (in which form it appears in\\nthe \"Poem of the Cid\"), San Servantes, and San Cervantes: with regard to\\nwhich last the \"Handbook for Spain\" warns its readers against the\\nsupposition that it has anything to do with the author of \"Don Quixote.\"\\nFord, as all know who have taken him for a companion and counsellor on\\nthe roads of Spain, is seldom wrong in matters of literature or history.\\nIn this instance, however, he is in error. It has everything to do with\\nthe author of \"Don Quixote,\" for it is in fact these old walls that have\\ngiven to Spain the name she is proudest of to-day. Gonzalo, above\\nmentioned, it may be readily conceived, did not relish the appropriation\\nby his brother of a name to which he himself had an equal right, for\\nthough nominally taken from the castle, it was in reality derived from\\nthe ancient territorial possession of the family, and as a set-off, and\\nto distinguish himself (diferenciarse) from his brother, he took as a\\nsurname the name of the castle on the bank of the Tagus, in the building\\nof which, according to a family tradition, his great-grandfather had a\\nshare.',\n",
       " 'Both brothers founded families. The Cervantes branch had more tenacity;\\nit sent offshoots in various directions, Andalusia, Estremadura, Galicia,\\nand Portugal, and produced a goodly line of men distinguished in the\\nservice of Church and State. Gonzalo himself, and apparently a son of\\nhis, followed Ferdinand III in the great campaign of 1236-48 that gave\\nCordova and Seville to Christian Spain and penned up the Moors in the\\nkingdom of Granada, and his descendants intermarried with some of the\\nnoblest families of the Peninsula and numbered among them soldiers,\\nmagistrates, and Church dignitaries, including at least two\\ncardinal-archbishops.',\n",
       " 'Of the line that settled in Andalusia, Deigo de Cervantes, Commander of\\nthe Order of Santiago, married Juana Avellaneda, daughter of Juan Arias\\nde Saavedra, and had several sons, of whom one was Gonzalo Gomez,\\nCorregidor of Jerez and ancestor of the Mexican and Columbian branches of\\nthe family; and another, Juan, whose son Rodrigo married Dona Leonor de\\nCortinas, and by her had four children, Rodrigo, Andrea, Luisa, and\\nMiguel, our author.',\n",
       " 'The pedigree of Cervantes is not without its bearing on \"Don Quixote.\" A\\nman who could look back upon an ancestry of genuine knights-errant\\nextending from well-nigh the time of Pelayo to the siege of Granada was\\nlikely to have a strong feeling on the subject of the sham chivalry of\\nthe romances. It gives a point, too, to what he says in more than one\\nplace about families that have once been great and have tapered away\\nuntil they have come to nothing, like a pyramid. It was the case of his\\nown.',\n",
       " 'He was born at Alcala de Henares and baptised in the church of Santa\\nMaria Mayor on the 9th of October, 1547. Of his boyhood and youth we know\\nnothing, unless it be from the glimpse he gives us in the preface to his\\n\"Comedies\" of himself as a boy looking on with delight while Lope de\\nRueda and his company set up their rude plank stage in the plaza and\\nacted the rustic farces which he himself afterwards took as the model of\\nhis interludes. This first glimpse, however, is a significant one, for it\\nshows the early development of that love of the drama which exercised\\nsuch an influence on his life and seems to have grown stronger as he grew\\nolder, and of which this very preface, written only a few months before\\nhis death, is such a striking proof. He gives us to understand, too, that\\nhe was a great reader in his youth; but of this no assurance was needed,\\nfor the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" alone proves a vast amount of\\nmiscellaneous reading, romances of chivalry, ballads, popular poetry,\\nchronicles, for which he had no time or opportunity except in the first\\ntwenty years of his life; and his misquotations and mistakes in matters\\nof detail are always, it may be noticed, those of a man recalling the\\nreading of his boyhood.',\n",
       " \"Other things besides the drama were in their infancy when Cervantes was a\\nboy. The period of his boyhood was in every way a transition period for\\nSpain. The old chivalrous Spain had passed away. The new Spain was the\\nmightiest power the world had seen since the Roman Empire and it had not\\nyet been called upon to pay the price of its greatness. By the policy of\\nFerdinand and Ximenez the sovereign had been made absolute, and the\\nChurch and Inquisition adroitly adjusted to keep him so. The nobles, who\\nhad always resisted absolutism as strenuously as they had fought the\\nMoors, had been divested of all political power, a like fate had befallen\\nthe cities, the free constitutions of Castile and Aragon had been swept\\naway, and the only function that remained to the Cortes was that of\\ngranting money at the King's dictation.\",\n",
       " 'The transition extended to literature. Men who, like Garcilaso de la Vega\\nand Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, followed the Italian wars, had brought back\\nfrom Italy the products of the post-Renaissance literature, which took\\nroot and flourished and even threatened to extinguish the native growths.\\nDamon and Thyrsis, Phyllis and Chloe had been fairly naturalised in\\nSpain, together with all the devices of pastoral poetry for investing\\nwith an air of novelty the idea of a dispairing shepherd and inflexible\\nshepherdess. As a set-off against this, the old historical and\\ntraditional ballads, and the true pastorals, the songs and ballads of\\npeasant life, were being collected assiduously and printed in the\\ncancioneros that succeeded one another with increasing rapidity. But the\\nmost notable consequence, perhaps, of the spread of printing was the\\nflood of romances of chivalry that had continued to pour from the press\\never since Garci Ordonez de Montalvo had resuscitated \"Amadis of Gaul\" at\\nthe beginning of the century.',\n",
       " 'For a youth fond of reading, solid or light, there could have been no\\nbetter spot in Spain than Alcala de Henares in the middle of the\\nsixteenth century. It was then a busy, populous university town,\\nsomething more than the enterprising rival of Salamanca, and altogether a\\nvery different place from the melancholy, silent, deserted Alcala the\\ntraveller sees now as he goes from Madrid to Saragossa. Theology and\\nmedicine may have been the strong points of the university, but the town\\nitself seems to have inclined rather to the humanities and light\\nliterature, and as a producer of books Alcala was already beginning to\\ncompete with the older presses of Toledo, Burgos, Salamanca and Seville.',\n",
       " 'A pendant to the picture Cervantes has given us of his first playgoings\\nmight, no doubt, have been often seen in the streets of Alcala at that\\ntime; a bright, eager, tawny-haired boy peering into a book-shop where\\nthe latest volumes lay open to tempt the public, wondering, it may be,\\nwhat that little book with the woodcut of the blind beggar and his boy,\\nthat called itself \"Vida de Lazarillo de Tormes, segunda impresion,\"\\ncould be about; or with eyes brimming over with merriment gazing at one\\nof those preposterous portraits of a knight-errant in outrageous panoply\\nand plumes with which the publishers of chivalry romances loved to\\nembellish the title-pages of their folios. If the boy was the father of\\nthe man, the sense of the incongruous that was strong at fifty was lively\\nat ten, and some such reflections as these may have been the true genesis\\nof \"Don Quixote.\"',\n",
       " 'For his more solid education, we are told, he went to Salamanca. But why\\nRodrigo de Cervantes, who was very poor, should have sent his son to a\\nuniversity a hundred and fifty miles away when he had one at his own\\ndoor, would be a puzzle, if we had any reason for supposing that he did\\nso. The only evidence is a vague statement by Professor Tomas Gonzalez,\\nthat he once saw an old entry of the matriculation of a Miguel de\\nCervantes. This does not appear to have been ever seen again; but even if\\nit had, and if the date corresponded, it would prove nothing, as there\\nwere at least two other Miguels born about the middle of the century; one\\nof them, moreover, a Cervantes Saavedra, a cousin, no doubt, who was a\\nsource of great embarrassment to the biographers.',\n",
       " 'That he was a student neither at Salamanca nor at Alcala is best proved\\nby his own works. No man drew more largely upon experience than he did,\\nand he has nowhere left a single reminiscence of student life-for the\\n\"Tia Fingida,\" if it be his, is not one--nothing, not even \"a college\\njoke,\" to show that he remembered days that most men remember best. All\\nthat we know positively about his education is that Juan Lopez de Hoyos,\\na professor of humanities and belles-lettres of some eminence, calls him\\nhis \"dear and beloved pupil.\" This was in a little collection of verses\\nby different hands on the death of Isabel de Valois, second queen of\\nPhilip II, published by the professor in 1569, to which Cervantes\\ncontributed four pieces, including an elegy, and an epitaph in the form\\nof a sonnet. It is only by a rare chance that a \"Lycidas\" finds its way\\ninto a volume of this sort, and Cervantes was no Milton. His verses are\\nno worse than such things usually are; so much, at least, may be said for\\nthem.',\n",
       " \"By the time the book appeared he had left Spain, and, as fate ordered it,\\nfor twelve years, the most eventful ones of his life. Giulio, afterwards\\nCardinal, Acquaviva had been sent at the end of 1568 to Philip II by the\\nPope on a mission, partly of condolence, partly political, and on his\\nreturn to Rome, which was somewhat brusquely expedited by the King, he\\ntook Cervantes with him as his camarero (chamberlain), the office he\\nhimself held in the Pope's household. The post would no doubt have led to\\nadvancement at the Papal Court had Cervantes retained it, but in the\\nsummer of 1570 he resigned it and enlisted as a private soldier in\\nCaptain Diego Urbina's company, belonging to Don Miguel de Moncada's\\nregiment, but at that time forming a part of the command of Marc Antony\\nColonna. What impelled him to this step we know not, whether it was\\ndistaste for the career before him, or purely military enthusiasm. It may\\nwell have been the latter, for it was a stirring time; the events,\\nhowever, which led to the alliance between Spain, Venice, and the Pope,\\nagainst the common enemy, the Porte, and to the victory of the combined\\nfleets at Lepanto, belong rather to the history of Europe than to the\\nlife of Cervantes. He was one of those that sailed from Messina, in\\nSeptember 1571, under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the\\nmorning of the 7th of October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was\\nlying below ill with fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he\\nrose, and, in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors,\\ninsisted on taking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of\\nGod and the King to health. His galley, the Marquesa, was in the thick of\\nthe fight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds,\\ntwo in the breast and one in the left hand or arm. On the morning after\\nthe battle, according to Navarrete, he had an interview with the\\ncommander-in-chief, Don John, who was making a personal inspection of the\\nwounded, one result of which was an addition of three crowns to his pay,\\nand another, apparently, the friendship of his general.\",\n",
       " 'How severely Cervantes was wounded may be inferred from the fact, that\\nwith youth, a vigorous frame, and as cheerful and buoyant a temperament\\nas ever invalid had, he was seven months in hospital at Messina before he\\nwas discharged. He came out with his left hand permanently disabled; he\\nhad lost the use of it, as Mercury told him in the \"Viaje del Parnaso\"\\nfor the greater glory of the right. This, however, did not absolutely\\nunfit him for service, and in April 1572 he joined Manuel Ponce de Leon\\'s\\ncompany of Lope de Figueroa\\'s regiment, in which, it seems probable, his\\nbrother Rodrigo was serving, and shared in the operations of the next\\nthree years, including the capture of the Goletta and Tunis. Taking\\nadvantage of the lull which followed the recapture of these places by the\\nTurks, he obtained leave to return to Spain, and sailed from Naples in\\nSeptember 1575 on board the Sun galley, in company with his brother\\nRodrigo, Pedro Carrillo de Quesada, late Governor of the Goletta, and\\nsome others, and furnished with letters from Don John of Austria and the\\nDuke of Sesa, the Viceroy of Sicily, recommending him to the King for the\\ncommand of a company, on account of his services; a dono infelice as\\nevents proved. On the 26th they fell in with a squadron of Algerine\\ngalleys, and after a stout resistance were overpowered and carried into\\nAlgiers.',\n",
       " 'By means of a ransomed fellow-captive the brothers contrived to inform\\ntheir family of their condition, and the poor people at Alcala at once\\nstrove to raise the ransom money, the father disposing of all he\\npossessed, and the two sisters giving up their marriage portions. But\\nDali Mami had found on Cervantes the letters addressed to the King by Don\\nJohn and the Duke of Sesa, and, concluding that his prize must be a\\nperson of great consequence, when the money came he refused it scornfully\\nas being altogether insufficient. The owner of Rodrigo, however, was more\\neasily satisfied; ransom was accepted in his case, and it was arranged\\nbetween the brothers that he should return to Spain and procure a vessel\\nin which he was to come back to Algiers and take off Miguel and as many\\nof their comrades as possible. This was not the first attempt to escape\\nthat Cervantes had made. Soon after the commencement of his captivity he\\ninduced several of his companions to join him in trying to reach Oran,\\nthen a Spanish post, on foot; but after the first day\\'s journey, the Moor\\nwho had agreed to act as their guide deserted them, and they had no\\nchoice but to return. The second attempt was more disastrous. In a garden\\noutside the city on the sea-shore, he constructed, with the help of the\\ngardener, a Spaniard, a hiding-place, to which he brought, one by one,\\nfourteen of his fellow-captives, keeping them there in secrecy for\\nseveral months, and supplying them with food through a renegade known as\\nEl Dorador, \"the Gilder.\" How he, a captive himself, contrived to do all\\nthis, is one of the mysteries of the story. Wild as the project may\\nappear, it was very nearly successful. The vessel procured by Rodrigo\\nmade its appearance off the coast, and under cover of night was\\nproceeding to take off the refugees, when the crew were alarmed by a\\npassing fishing boat, and beat a hasty retreat. On renewing the attempt\\nshortly afterwards, they, or a portion of them at least, were taken\\nprisoners, and just as the poor fellows in the garden were exulting in\\nthe thought that in a few moments more freedom would be within their\\ngrasp, they found themselves surrounded by Turkish troops, horse and\\nfoot. The Dorador had revealed the whole scheme to the Dey Hassan.',\n",
       " 'When Cervantes saw what had befallen them, he charged his companions to\\nlay all the blame upon him, and as they were being bound he declared\\naloud that the whole plot was of his contriving, and that nobody else had\\nany share in it. Brought before the Dey, he said the same. He was\\nthreatened with impalement and with torture; and as cutting off ears and\\nnoses were playful freaks with the Algerines, it may be conceived what\\ntheir tortures were like; but nothing could make him swerve from his\\noriginal statement that he and he alone was responsible. The upshot was\\nthat the unhappy gardener was hanged by his master, and the prisoners\\ntaken possession of by the Dey, who, however, afterwards restored most of\\nthem to their masters, but kept Cervantes, paying Dali Mami 500 crowns\\nfor him. He felt, no doubt, that a man of such resource, energy, and\\ndaring, was too dangerous a piece of property to be left in private\\nhands; and he had him heavily ironed and lodged in his own prison. If he\\nthought that by these means he could break the spirit or shake the\\nresolution of his prisoner, he was soon undeceived, for Cervantes\\ncontrived before long to despatch a letter to the Governor of Oran,\\nentreating him to send him some one that could be trusted, to enable him\\nand three other gentlemen, fellow-captives of his, to make their escape;\\nintending evidently to renew his first attempt with a more trustworthy\\nguide. Unfortunately the Moor who carried the letter was stopped just\\noutside Oran, and the letter being found upon him, he was sent back to\\nAlgiers, where by the order of the Dey he was promptly impaled as a\\nwarning to others, while Cervantes was condemned to receive two thousand\\nblows of the stick, a number which most likely would have deprived the\\nworld of \"Don Quixote,\" had not some persons, who they were we know not,\\ninterceded on his behalf.',\n",
       " 'After this he seems to have been kept in still closer confinement than\\nbefore, for nearly two years passed before he made another attempt. This\\ntime his plan was to purchase, by the aid of a Spanish renegade and two\\nValencian merchants resident in Algiers, an armed vessel in which he and\\nabout sixty of the leading captives were to make their escape; but just\\nas they were about to put it into execution one Doctor Juan Blanco de\\nPaz, an ecclesiastic and a compatriot, informed the Dey of the plot.\\nCervantes by force of character, by his self-devotion, by his untiring\\nenergy and his exertions to lighten the lot of his companions in misery,\\nhad endeared himself to all, and become the leading spirit in the captive\\ncolony, and, incredible as it may seem, jealousy of his influence and the\\nesteem in which he was held, moved this man to compass his destruction by\\na cruel death. The merchants finding that the Dey knew all, and fearing\\nthat Cervantes under torture might make disclosures that would imperil\\ntheir own lives, tried to persuade him to slip away on board a vessel\\nthat was on the point of sailing for Spain; but he told them they had\\nnothing to fear, for no tortures would make him compromise anybody, and\\nhe went at once and gave himself up to the Dey.',\n",
       " 'As before, the Dey tried to force him to name his accomplices. Everything\\nwas made ready for his immediate execution; the halter was put round his\\nneck and his hands tied behind him, but all that could be got from him\\nwas that he himself, with the help of four gentlemen who had since left\\nAlgiers, had arranged the whole, and that the sixty who were to accompany\\nhim were not to know anything of it until the last moment. Finding he\\ncould make nothing of him, the Dey sent him back to prison more heavily\\nironed than before.',\n",
       " 'The poverty-stricken Cervantes family had been all this time trying once\\nmore to raise the ransom money, and at last a sum of three hundred ducats\\nwas got together and entrusted to the Redemptorist Father Juan Gil, who\\nwas about to sail for Algiers. The Dey, however, demanded more than\\ndouble the sum offered, and as his term of office had expired and he was\\nabout to sail for Constantinople, taking all his slaves with him, the\\ncase of Cervantes was critical. He was already on board heavily ironed,\\nwhen the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and\\nFather Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September\\n19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was\\nat last set free. Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who\\nclaimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false\\nevidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return\\nto Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five\\nquestions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he\\nrequested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before\\na notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in\\nAlgiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more\\nbesides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and\\ngratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of\\nthe notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of\\nCervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up\\ntheir drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent,\\nand how \"in him this deponent found father and mother.\"',\n",
       " 'On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for\\nPortugal to support Philip\\'s claim to the crown, and utterly penniless\\nnow, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to the\\nAzores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war\\nreturned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the manuscript\\nof his pastoral romance, the \"Galatea,\" and probably also, to judge by\\ninternal evidence, that of the first portion of \"Persiles and\\nSigismunda.\" He also brought back with him, his biographers assert, an\\ninfant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great\\ncircumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose\\nname, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, they omit to\\nmention. The sole foundation for all this is that in 1605 there certainly\\nwas living in the family of Cervantes a Dona Isabel de Saavedra, who is\\ndescribed in an official document as his natural daughter, and then\\ntwenty years of age.',\n",
       " 'With his crippled left hand promotion in the army was hopeless, now that\\nDon John was dead and he had no one to press his claims and services, and\\nfor a man drawing on to forty life in the ranks was a dismal prospect; he\\nhad already a certain reputation as a poet; he made up his mind,\\ntherefore, to cast his lot with literature, and for a first venture\\ncommitted his \"Galatea\" to the press. It was published, as Salva y Mallen\\nshows conclusively, at Alcala, his own birth-place, in 1585 and no doubt\\nhelped to make his name more widely known, but certainly did not do him\\nmuch good in any other way.',\n",
       " 'While it was going through the press, he married Dona Catalina de\\nPalacios Salazar y Vozmediano, a lady of Esquivias near Madrid, and\\napparently a friend of the family, who brought him a fortune which may\\npossibly have served to keep the wolf from the door, but if so, that was\\nall. The drama had by this time outgrown market-place stages and\\nstrolling companies, and with his old love for it he naturally turned to\\nit for a congenial employment. In about three years he wrote twenty or\\nthirty plays, which he tells us were performed without any throwing of\\ncucumbers or other missiles, and ran their course without any hisses,\\noutcries, or disturbance. In other words, his plays were not bad enough\\nto be hissed off the stage, but not good enough to hold their own upon\\nit. Only two of them have been preserved, but as they happen to be two of\\nthe seven or eight he mentions with complacency, we may assume they are\\nfavourable specimens, and no one who reads the \"Numancia\" and the \"Trato\\nde Argel\" will feel any surprise that they failed as acting dramas.\\nWhatever merits they may have, whatever occasional they may show, they\\nare, as regards construction, incurably clumsy. How completely they\\nfailed is manifest from the fact that with all his sanguine temperament\\nand indomitable perseverance he was unable to maintain the struggle to\\ngain a livelihood as a dramatist for more than three years; nor was the\\nrising popularity of Lope the cause, as is often said, notwithstanding\\nhis own words to the contrary. When Lope began to write for the stage is\\nuncertain, but it was certainly after Cervantes went to Seville.',\n",
       " 'Among the \"Nuevos Documentos\" printed by Senor Asensio y Toledo is one\\ndated 1592, and curiously characteristic of Cervantes. It is an agreement\\nwith one Rodrigo Osorio, a manager, who was to accept six comedies at\\nfifty ducats (about 6l.) apiece, not to be paid in any case unless it\\nappeared on representation that the said comedy was one of the best that\\nhad ever been represented in Spain. The test does not seem to have been\\never applied; perhaps it was sufficiently apparent to Rodrigo Osorio that\\nthe comedies were not among the best that had ever been represented.\\nAmong the correspondence of Cervantes there might have been found, no\\ndoubt, more than one letter like that we see in the \"Rake\\'s Progress,\"\\n\"Sir, I have read your play, and it will not doo.\"',\n",
       " \"He was more successful in a literary contest at Saragossa in 1595 in\\nhonour of the canonisation of St. Jacinto, when his composition won the\\nfirst prize, three silver spoons. The year before this he had been\\nappointed a collector of revenues for the kingdom of Granada. In order to\\nremit the money he had collected more conveniently to the treasury, he\\nentrusted it to a merchant, who failed and absconded; and as the\\nbankrupt's assets were insufficient to cover the whole, he was sent to\\nprison at Seville in September 1597. The balance against him, however,\\nwas a small one, about 26l., and on giving security for it he was\\nreleased at the end of the year.\",\n",
       " 'It was as he journeyed from town to town collecting the king\\'s taxes,\\nthat he noted down those bits of inn and wayside life and character that\\nabound in the pages of \"Don Quixote:\" the Benedictine monks with\\nspectacles and sunshades, mounted on their tall mules; the strollers in\\ncostume bound for the next village; the barber with his basin on his\\nhead, on his way to bleed a patient; the recruit with his breeches in his\\nbundle, tramping along the road singing; the reapers gathered in the\\nventa gateway listening to \"Felixmarte of Hircania\" read out to them; and\\nthose little Hogarthian touches that he so well knew how to bring in, the\\nox-tail hanging up with the landlord\\'s comb stuck in it, the wine-skins\\nat the bed-head, and those notable examples of hostelry art, Helen going\\noff in high spirits on Paris\\'s arm, and Dido on the tower dropping tears\\nas big as walnuts. Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote\\nregions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman,\\nwith his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry, dreaming\\naway his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his\\ngreat-grandfather\\'s old helmet was new. But it was in Seville that he\\nfound out his true vocation, though he himself would not by any means\\nhave admitted it to be so. It was there, in Triana, that he was first\\ntempted to try his hand at drawing from life, and first brought his\\nhumour into play in the exquisite little sketch of \"Rinconete y\\nCortadillo,\" the germ, in more ways than one, of \"Don Quixote.\"',\n",
       " 'Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonment\\nall trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which it\\nmay be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in Seville\\nin November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaborate\\ncatafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of\\nPhilip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements. The\\nwords in the preface to the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" are generally\\nheld to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote\\nthe beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so\\nis extremely likely.',\n",
       " 'There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a\\nselect audience at the Duke of Bejar\\'s, which may have helped to make the\\nbook known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \"Don\\nQuixote\" lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold\\nenough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little\\nfaith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it,\\nthat he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for\\nAragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The\\nprinting was finished in December, and the book came out with the new\\nyear, 1605. It is often said that \"Don Quixote\" was at first received\\ncoldly. The facts show just the contrary. No sooner was it in the hands\\nof the public than preparations were made to issue pirated editions at\\nLisbon and Valencia, and to bring out a second edition with the\\nadditional copyrights for Aragon and Portugal, which he secured in\\nFebruary.',\n",
       " 'No doubt it was received with something more than coldness by certain\\nsections of the community. Men of wit, taste, and discrimination among\\nthe aristocracy gave it a hearty welcome, but the aristocracy in general\\nwere not likely to relish a book that turned their favourite reading into\\nridicule and laughed at so many of their favourite ideas. The dramatists\\nwho gathered round Lope as their leader regarded Cervantes as their\\ncommon enemy, and it is plain that he was equally obnoxious to the other\\nclique, the culto poets who had Gongora for their chief. Navarrete, who\\nknew nothing of the letter above mentioned, tries hard to show that the\\nrelations between Cervantes and Lope were of a very friendly sort, as\\nindeed they were until \"Don Quixote\" was written. Cervantes, indeed, to\\nthe last generously and manfully declared his admiration of Lope\\'s\\npowers, his unfailing invention, and his marvellous fertility; but in the\\npreface of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" and in the verses of \"Urganda\\nthe Unknown,\" and one or two other places, there are, if we read between\\nthe lines, sly hits at Lope\\'s vanities and affectations that argue no\\npersonal good-will; and Lope openly sneers at \"Don Quixote\" and\\nCervantes, and fourteen years after his death gives him only a few lines\\nof cold commonplace in the \"Laurel de Apolo,\" that seem all the colder\\nfor the eulogies of a host of nonentities whose names are found nowhere\\nelse.',\n",
       " \"In 1601 Valladolid was made the seat of the Court, and at the beginning\\nof 1603 Cervantes had been summoned thither in connection with the\\nbalance due by him to the Treasury, which was still outstanding. He\\nremained at Valladolid, apparently supporting himself by agencies and\\nscrivener's work of some sort; probably drafting petitions and drawing up\\nstatements of claims to be presented to the Council, and the like. So, at\\nleast, we gather from the depositions taken on the occasion of the death\\nof a gentleman, the victim of a street brawl, who had been carried into\\nthe house in which he lived. In these he himself is described as a man\\nwho wrote and transacted business, and it appears that his household then\\nconsisted of his wife, the natural daughter Isabel de Saavedra already\\nmentioned, his sister Andrea, now a widow, her daughter Constanza, a\\nmysterious Magdalena de Sotomayor calling herself his sister, for whom\\nhis biographers cannot account, and a servant-maid.\",\n",
       " 'Meanwhile \"Don Quixote\" had been growing in favour, and its author\\'s name\\nwas now known beyond the Pyrenees. In 1607 an edition was printed at\\nBrussels. Robles, the Madrid publisher, found it necessary to meet the\\ndemand by a third edition, the seventh in all, in 1608. The popularity of\\nthe book in Italy was such that a Milan bookseller was led to bring out\\nan edition in 1610; and another was called for in Brussels in 1611. It\\nmight naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that\\nhe had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set\\nabout redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume.',\n",
       " 'But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had\\nstill by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had\\ninserted in \"Don Quixote\" and instead of continuing the adventures of Don\\nQuixote, he set to work to write more of these \"Novelas Exemplares\" as he\\nafterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.',\n",
       " 'The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the\\nConde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty\\nconfidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and\\na half after the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had appeared, we get the\\nfirst hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \"You shall see shortly,\" he\\nsays, \"the further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\"\\nHis idea of \"shortly\" was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the\\ndate to Sancho\\'s letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed\\nthat time twelvemonth.',\n",
       " 'But more than poems, or pastorals, or novels, it was his dramatic\\nambition that engrossed his thoughts. The same indomitable spirit that\\nkept him from despair in the bagnios of Algiers, and prompted him to\\nattempt the escape of himself and his comrades again and again, made him\\npersevere in spite of failure and discouragement in his efforts to win\\nthe ear of the public as a dramatist. The temperament of Cervantes was\\nessentially sanguine. The portrait he draws in the preface to the novels,\\nwith the aquiline features, chestnut hair, smooth untroubled forehead,\\nand bright cheerful eyes, is the very portrait of a sanguine man. Nothing\\nthat the managers might say could persuade him that the merits of his\\nplays would not be recognised at last if they were only given a fair\\nchance. The old soldier of the Spanish Salamis was bent on being the\\nAeschylus of Spain. He was to found a great national drama, based on the\\ntrue principles of art, that was to be the envy of all nations; he was to\\ndrive from the stage the silly, childish plays, the \"mirrors of nonsense\\nand models of folly\" that were in vogue through the cupidity of the\\nmanagers and shortsightedness of the authors; he was to correct and\\neducate the public taste until it was ripe for tragedies on the model of\\nthe Greek drama--like the \"Numancia\" for instance--and comedies that\\nwould not only amuse but improve and instruct. All this he was to do,\\ncould he once get a hearing: there was the initial difficulty.',\n",
       " 'He shows plainly enough, too, that \"Don Quixote\" and the demolition of\\nthe chivalry romances was not the work that lay next his heart. He was,\\nindeed, as he says himself in his preface, more a stepfather than a\\nfather to \"Don Quixote.\" Never was great work so neglected by its author.\\nThat it was written carelessly, hastily, and by fits and starts, was not\\nalways his fault, but it seems clear he never read what he sent to the\\npress. He knew how the printers had blundered, but he never took the\\ntrouble to correct them when the third edition was in progress, as a man\\nwho really cared for the child of his brain would have done. He appears\\nto have regarded the book as little more than a mere libro de\\nentretenimiento, an amusing book, a thing, as he says in the \"Viaje,\" \"to\\ndivert the melancholy moody heart at any time or season.\" No doubt he had\\nan affection for his hero, and was very proud of Sancho Panza. It would\\nhave been strange indeed if he had not been proud of the most humorous\\ncreation in all fiction. He was proud, too, of the popularity and success\\nof the book, and beyond measure delightful is the naivete with which he\\nshows his pride in a dozen passages in the Second Part. But it was not\\nthe success he coveted. In all probability he would have given all the\\nsuccess of \"Don Quixote,\" nay, would have seen every copy of \"Don\\nQuixote\" burned in the Plaza Mayor, for one such success as Lope de Vega\\nwas enjoying on an average once a week.',\n",
       " 'And so he went on, dawdling over \"Don Quixote,\" adding a chapter now and\\nagain, and putting it aside to turn to \"Persiles and Sigismunda\"--which,\\nas we know, was to be the most entertaining book in the language, and the\\nrival of \"Theagenes and Chariclea\"--or finishing off one of his darling\\ncomedies; and if Robles asked when \"Don Quixote\" would be ready, the\\nanswer no doubt was: En breve-shortly, there was time enough for that. At\\nsixty-eight he was as full of life and hope and plans for the future as a\\nboy of eighteen.',\n",
       " 'Nemesis was coming, however. He had got as far as Chapter LIX, which at\\nhis leisurely pace he could hardly have reached before October or\\nNovember 1614, when there was put into his hand a small octave lately\\nprinted at Tarragona, and calling itself \"Second Volume of the Ingenious\\nGentleman Don Quixote of La Mancha: by the Licentiate Alonso Fernandez de\\nAvellaneda of Tordesillas.\" The last half of Chapter LIX and most of the\\nfollowing chapters of the Second Part give us some idea of the effect\\nproduced upon him, and his irritation was not likely to be lessened by\\nthe reflection that he had no one to blame but himself. Had Avellaneda,\\nin fact, been content with merely bringing out a continuation to \"Don\\nQuixote,\" Cervantes would have had no reasonable grievance. His own\\nintentions were expressed in the very vaguest language at the end of the\\nbook; nay, in his last words, \"forse altro cantera con miglior plettro,\"\\nhe seems actually to invite some one else to continue the work, and he\\nmade no sign until eight years and a half had gone by; by which time\\nAvellaneda\\'s volume was no doubt written.',\n",
       " \"In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere\\ncontinuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to\\nit, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man\\ncould pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his\\nhand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless,\\naccuses him of envy of Lope's success, of petulance and querulousness,\\nand so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda's reason for\\nthis personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is\\nclear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope's school, for he has the\\nimpudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his\\ncriticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics\\nand baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear\\non it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes\\nknew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an\\ninvisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a\\nmosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language\\npronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself,\\nsupports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an\\necclesiastic, a Dominican probably.\",\n",
       " 'Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull\\nto reflect much. \"Dull and dirty\" will always be, I imagine, the verdict\\nof the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor\\nplagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by\\nCervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for\\ncastles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and\\nSancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all\\nthrough he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has\\ncontrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth\\ncentury novellieri and without their sprightliness.',\n",
       " 'But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the debt\\nwe owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, \"Don Quixote\" would\\nhave come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if\\nCervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he would\\nhave left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further\\nadventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It is\\nplain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral\\nromances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but for\\nAvellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is more likely\\nthat, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume would\\nhave remained unfinished till his death, and that we should have never\\nmade the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with Sancho to\\nBarataria.',\n",
       " 'From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been\\nhaunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field,\\nand putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off his task\\nand protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him. The\\nconclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work\\nand the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda\\nbecomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion\\nand for that we must thank Avellaneda.',\n",
       " 'The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed\\ntill the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put together\\nthe comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years,\\nand, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, and\\npublished them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, in\\nwhich he gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his own\\nattempts as a dramatist. It is needless to say they were put forward by\\nCervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits. The\\nreader, however, was not to suppose they were his last word or final\\neffort in the drama, for he had in hand a comedy called \"Engano a los\\nojos,\" about which, if he mistook not, there would be no question.',\n",
       " 'Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his\\nhealth had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of dropsy,\\non the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare,\\nnominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed.\\nHe died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully.',\n",
       " 'Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell us\\nthat it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life of\\npoverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, but\\nCervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils. His was\\nnot one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue\\nof their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he\\nwas proof against it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way\\nto despondency or prostrated by dejection. As for poverty, it was with\\nhim a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he ever allows to\\nescape him is when he says, \"Happy he to whom Heaven has given a piece of\\nbread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.\"\\nAdd to all this his vital energy and mental activity, his restless\\ninvention and his sanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough\\nto doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life. He who could\\ntake Cervantes\\' distresses together with his apparatus for enduring them\\nwould not make so bad a bargain, perhaps, as far as happiness in life is\\nconcerned.',\n",
       " 'Of his burial-place nothing is known except that he was buried, in\\naccordance with his will, in the neighbouring convent of Trinitarian\\nnuns, of which it is supposed his daughter, Isabel de Saavedra, was an\\ninmate, and that a few years afterwards the nuns removed to another\\nconvent, carrying their dead with them. But whether the remains of\\nCervantes were included in the removal or not no one knows, and the clue\\nto their resting-place is now lost beyond all hope. This furnishes\\nperhaps the least defensible of the items in the charge of neglect\\nbrought against his contemporaries. In some of the others there is a good\\ndeal of exaggeration. To listen to most of his biographers one would\\nsuppose that all Spain was in league not only against the man but against\\nhis memory, or at least that it was insensible to his merits, and left\\nhim to live in misery and die of want. To talk of his hard life and\\nunworthy employments in Andalusia is absurd. What had he done to\\ndistinguish him from thousands of other struggling men earning a\\nprecarious livelihood? True, he was a gallant soldier, who had been\\nwounded and had undergone captivity and suffering in his country\\'s cause,\\nbut there were hundreds of others in the same case. He had written a\\nmediocre specimen of an insipid class of romance, and some plays which\\nmanifestly did not comply with the primary condition of pleasing: were\\nthe playgoers to patronise plays that did not amuse them, because the\\nauthor was to produce \"Don Quixote\" twenty years afterwards?',\n",
       " 'The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on\\nthe appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to\\nits merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man writes\\na book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldly\\nreceived by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of\\nwigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the\\nsentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all against\\nhim, it was because \"Don Quixote\" was what it was; and if the general\\npublic did not come forward to make him comfortable for the rest of his\\ndays, it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the\\nEnglish-speaking public that did not pay off Scott\\'s liabilities. It did\\nthe best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it, and\\nencouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others.',\n",
       " 'It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no\\nmonument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of\\nhim; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las\\nCortes, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set\\nup to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not\\nworthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of \"such\\nweak witness of his name;\" or what could a monument do in his case except\\ntestify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up? Si\\nmonumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller\\'s shop will show\\nwhat bathos there would be in a monument to the author of \"Don Quixote.\"',\n",
       " 'Nine editions of the First Part of \"Don Quixote\" had already appeared\\nbefore Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his\\nown estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his\\ndeath. So large a number naturally supplied the demand for some time, but\\nby 1634 it appears to have been exhausted; and from that time down to the\\npresent day the stream of editions has continued to flow rapidly and\\nregularly. The translations show still more clearly in what request the\\nbook has been from the very outset. In seven years from the completion of\\nthe work it had been translated into the four leading languages of\\nEurope. Except the Bible, in fact, no book has been so widely diffused as\\n\"Don Quixote.\" The \"Imitatio Christi\" may have been translated into as\\nmany different languages, and perhaps \"Robinson Crusoe\" and the \"Vicar of\\nWakefield\" into nearly as many, but in multiplicity of translations and\\neditions \"Don Quixote\" leaves them all far behind.',\n",
       " 'Still more remarkable is the character of this wide diffusion. \"Don\\nQuixote\" has been thoroughly naturalised among people whose ideas about\\nknight-errantry, if they had any at all, were of the vaguest, who had\\nnever seen or heard of a book of chivalry, who could not possibly feel\\nthe humour of the burlesque or sympathise with the author\\'s purpose.\\nAnother curious fact is that this, the most cosmopolitan book in the\\nworld, is one of the most intensely national. \"Manon Lescaut\" is not more\\nthoroughly French, \"Tom Jones\" not more English, \"Rob Roy\" not more\\nScotch, than \"Don Quixote\" is Spanish, in character, in ideas, in\\nsentiment, in local colour, in everything. What, then, is the secret of\\nthis unparalleled popularity, increasing year by year for well-nigh three\\ncenturies? One explanation, no doubt, is that of all the books in the\\nworld, \"Don Quixote\" is the most catholic. There is something in it for\\nevery sort of reader, young or old, sage or simple, high or low. As\\nCervantes himself says with a touch of pride, \"It is thumbed and read and\\ngot by heart by people of all sorts; the children turn its leaves, the\\nyoung people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise\\nit.\"',\n",
       " 'But it would be idle to deny that the ingredient which, more than its\\nhumour, or its wisdom, or the fertility of invention or knowledge of\\nhuman nature it displays, has insured its success with the multitude, is\\nthe vein of farce that runs through it. It was the attack upon the sheep,\\nthe battle with the wine-skins, Mambrino\\'s helmet, the balsam of\\nFierabras, Don Quixote knocked over by the sails of the windmill, Sancho\\ntossed in the blanket, the mishaps and misadventures of master and man,\\nthat were originally the great attraction, and perhaps are so still to\\nsome extent with the majority of readers. It is plain that \"Don Quixote\"\\nwas generally regarded at first, and indeed in Spain for a long time, as\\nlittle more than a queer droll book, full of laughable incidents and\\nabsurd situations, very amusing, but not entitled to much consideration\\nor care. All the editions printed in Spain from 1637 to 1771, when the\\nfamous printer Ibarra took it up, were mere trade editions, badly and\\ncarelessly printed on vile paper and got up in the style of chap-books\\nintended only for popular use, with, in most instances, uncouth\\nillustrations and clap-trap additions by the publisher.',\n",
       " 'To England belongs the credit of having been the first country to\\nrecognise the right of \"Don Quixote\" to better treatment than this. The\\nLondon edition of 1738, commonly called Lord Carteret\\'s from having been\\nsuggested by him, was not a mere edition de luxe. It produced \"Don\\nQuixote\" in becoming form as regards paper and type, and embellished with\\nplates which, if not particularly happy as illustrations, were at least\\nwell intentioned and well executed, but it also aimed at correctness of\\ntext, a matter to which nobody except the editors of the Valencia and\\nBrussels editions had given even a passing thought; and for a first\\nattempt it was fairly successful, for though some of its emendations are\\ninadmissible, a good many of them have been adopted by all subsequent\\neditors.',\n",
       " 'The zeal of publishers, editors, and annotators brought about a\\nremarkable change of sentiment with regard to \"Don Quixote.\" A vast\\nnumber of its admirers began to grow ashamed of laughing over it. It\\nbecame almost a crime to treat it as a humorous book. The humour was not\\nentirely denied, but, according to the new view, it was rated as an\\naltogether secondary quality, a mere accessory, nothing more than the\\nstalking-horse under the presentation of which Cervantes shot his\\nphilosophy or his satire, or whatever it was he meant to shoot; for on\\nthis point opinions varied. All were agreed, however, that the object he\\naimed at was not the books of chivalry. He said emphatically in the\\npreface to the First Part and in the last sentence of the Second, that he\\nhad no other object in view than to discredit these books, and this, to\\nadvanced criticism, made it clear that his object must have been\\nsomething else.',\n",
       " 'One theory was that the book was a kind of allegory, setting forth the\\neternal struggle between the ideal and the real, between the spirit of\\npoetry and the spirit of prose; and perhaps German philosophy never\\nevolved a more ungainly or unlikely camel out of the depths of its inner\\nconsciousness. Something of the antagonism, no doubt, is to be found in\\n\"Don Quixote,\" because it is to be found everywhere in life, and\\nCervantes drew from life. It is difficult to imagine a community in which\\nthe never-ceasing game of cross-purposes between Sancho Panza and Don\\nQuixote would not be recognized as true to nature. In the stone age,\\namong the lake dwellers, among the cave men, there were Don Quixotes and\\nSancho Panzas; there must have been the troglodyte who never could see\\nthe facts before his eyes, and the troglodyte who could see nothing else.\\nBut to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such\\nidea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very\\nunlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes\\nhimself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort\\nmade by anyone else.',\n",
       " 'The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is\\nquite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the\\nprodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth\\ncentury may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader\\nbears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the\\nlargest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is\\nabundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to\\ngrow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady\\nstream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to\\ntheir words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of\\ntheir readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust.',\n",
       " 'That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample\\nprovocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who\\nlook into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry\\nitself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that,\\nthanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no\\ngreater one than saying that \"Cervantes smiled Spain\\'s chivalry away.\" In\\nthe first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain\\'s\\nchivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done when\\nGranada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature,\\nit could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free\\ninstitutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was not chivalry\\nbut a degrading mockery of it.',\n",
       " 'The true nature of the \"right arm\" and the \"bright array,\" before which,\\naccording to the poet, \"the world gave ground,\" and which Cervantes\\'\\nsingle laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his own\\ncountrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in\\nhis \"Military Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.\" \"Before the appearance in the\\nworld of that labour of Cervantes,\" he said, \"it was next to an\\nimpossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without\\ndanger. There were seen so many cavaliers prancing and curvetting before\\nthe windows of their mistresses, that a stranger would have imagined the\\nwhole nation to have been nothing less than a race of knight-errants. But\\nafter the world became a little acquainted with that notable history, the\\nman that was seen in that once celebrated drapery was pointed at as a Don\\nQuixote, and found himself the jest of high and low. And I verily believe\\nthat to this, and this only, we owe that dampness and poverty of spirit\\nwhich has run through all our councils for a century past, so little\\nagreeable to those nobler actions of our famous ancestors.\"',\n",
       " 'To call \"Don Quixote\" a sad book, preaching a pessimist view of life,\\nargues a total misconception of its drift. It would be so if its moral\\nwere that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and\\ndiscomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as\\nit can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born\\nof vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to\\nan end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances and\\nconsequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerable\\nnuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot distinguish\\nbetween the one kind and the other, no doubt \"Don Quixote\" is a sad book;\\nno doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so\\nbeautiful a sentiment as that \"it is a hard case to make slaves of those\\nwhom God and Nature made free,\" should be ungratefully pelted by the\\nscoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others\\nof a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless\\nself-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for\\nall the mischief it does in the world.',\n",
       " 'A very slight examination of the structure of \"Don Quixote\" will suffice\\nto show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind\\nwhen he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which \"with a few\\nstrokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,\" he had\\nno idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him. There can\\nbe little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with\\nthose he had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results\\nthat might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act\\nthe part of a knight-errant in modern life.',\n",
       " \"It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the\\noriginal scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would not\\nhave omitted him in his hero's outfit, which he obviously meant to be\\ncomplete. Him we owe to the landlord's chance remark in Chapter III that\\nknights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don\\nQuixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair\\nof scissors.\",\n",
       " \"The story was written at first, like the others, without any division and\\nwithout the intervention of Cide Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not\\nunlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or\\nAldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking\\nof the Don's library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that\\nfirst suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What,\\nif instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make\\nhis tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style,\\nincidents, and spirit?\",\n",
       " 'In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily\\ndivided what he had written into chapters on the model of \"Amadis,\"\\ninvented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cide\\nHamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the\\nchivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some\\nrecondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value\\nof Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho\\'s part, but to\\nthe whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he\\nannounces his intention of taking his ass with him. \"About the ass,\" we\\nare told, \"Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call\\nto mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back;\\nbut no instance occurred to his memory.\" We can see the whole scene at a\\nglance, the stolid unconsciousness of Sancho and the perplexity of his\\nmaster, upon whose perception the incongruity has just forced itself.\\nThis is Sancho\\'s mission throughout the book; he is an unconscious\\nMephistopheles, always unwittingly making mockery of his master\\'s\\naspirations, always exposing the fallacy of his ideas by some\\nunintentional ad absurdum, always bringing him back to the world of fact\\nand commonplace by force of sheer stolidity.',\n",
       " 'By the time Cervantes had got his volume of novels off his hands, and\\nsummoned up resolution enough to set about the Second Part in earnest,\\nthe case was very much altered. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza had not\\nmerely found favour, but had already become, what they have never since\\nceased to be, veritable entities to the popular imagination. There was no\\noccasion for him now to interpolate extraneous matter; nay, his readers\\ntold him plainly that what they wanted of him was more Don Quixote and\\nmore Sancho Panza, and not novels, tales, or digressions. To himself,\\ntoo, his creations had become realities, and he had become proud of them,\\nespecially of Sancho. He began the Second Part, therefore, under very\\ndifferent conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once.\\nEven in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more\\nflowing, more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of\\nhis audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also. In the First\\nPart, Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He is\\nnothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the\\nchivalry romances. In all that he says and does he is simply repeating\\nthe lesson he has learned from his books; and therefore, it is absurd to\\nspeak of him in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they\\ndilate upon his nobleness, disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so\\nforth. It was the business of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress\\ninjuries, and succour the distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he\\nmakes his business when he takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound\\nto be intrepid, and so he feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron\\'s\\nmelodious nonsense about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is\\nthat \"\\'t is his virtue makes him mad!\" The exact opposite is the truth;\\nit is his madness makes him virtuous.',\n",
       " \"In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it was\\na point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that his\\nhero's madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of\\nchivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact,\\nwhose faculty of discernment is in perfect order. The advantage of this\\nis that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his\\nown reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the\\nrelief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace\\nbook.\",\n",
       " \"It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not\\nvery great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such\\nas his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection\\nfor Sancho together with his impatience of the squire's loquacity and\\nimpertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little more\\nthan a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a\\ngreat deal of shrewdness and originality of mind.\",\n",
       " \"As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to\\nthe First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he\\nhad been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him\\nin hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by\\nmaking him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was\\ntoo true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he\\nreappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a\\ndifference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same\\ntime with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline\\nhas been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few\\ntouches of a master's hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a\\ncharacter portrait by Velazquez. He is a much more important and\\nprominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his\\nmatchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the\\naction of the story.\",\n",
       " \"His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the\\nFirst Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of\\nthe highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in;\\nlike Falstaff's, they resemble the father that begets them; they are\\nsimple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the\\nservice of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see\\nwhen he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her\\nladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in\\nthis instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers\\nin his account of the journey on Clavileno.\",\n",
       " \"In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the\\nchivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of\\nthe sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of\\nMontesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and\\nanother distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote's blind\\nadoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere\\nanimalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to\\nmake merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes' humour the latter\\nwas naturally an attractive subject for ridicule. Like everything else in\\nthese romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of\\nchivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence\\nof those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets. When a troubadour\\nprofessed his readiness to obey his lady in all things, he made it\\nincumbent upon the next comer, if he wished to avoid the imputation of\\ntameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her will, which\\nthe next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so\\nexpressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings\\nat an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of\\nlove came into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern\\nEurope, and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of\\nBeatrice and Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found\\nexponents in writers like Feliciano de Silva. This is what Cervantes\\ndeals with in Don Quixote's passion for Dulcinea, and in no instance has\\nhe carried out the burlesque more happily. By keeping Dulcinea in the\\nbackground, and making her a vague shadowy being of whose very existence\\nwe are left in doubt, he invests Don Quixote's worship of her virtues and\\ncharms with an additional extravagance, and gives still more point to the\\ncaricature of the sentiment and language of the romances.\",\n",
       " 'One of the great merits of \"Don Quixote,\" and one of the qualities that\\nhave secured its acceptance by all classes of readers and made it the\\nmost cosmopolitan of books, is its simplicity. There are, of course,\\npoints obvious enough to a Spanish seventeenth century audience which do\\nnot immediately strike a reader now-a-days, and Cervantes often takes it\\nfor granted that an allusion will be generally understood which is only\\nintelligible to a few. For example, on many of his readers in Spain, and\\nmost of his readers out of it, the significance of his choice of a\\ncountry for his hero is completely lost. It would be going too far to say\\nthat no one can thoroughly comprehend \"Don Quixote\" without having seen\\nLa Mancha, but undoubtedly even a glimpse of La Mancha will give an\\ninsight into the meaning of Cervantes such as no commentator can give. Of\\nall the regions of Spain it is the last that would suggest the idea of\\nromance. Of all the dull central plateau of the Peninsula it is the\\ndullest tract. There is something impressive about the grim solitudes of\\nEstremadura; and if the plains of Leon and Old Castile are bald and\\ndreary, they are studded with old cities renowned in history and rich in\\nrelics of the past. But there is no redeeming feature in the Manchegan\\nlandscape; it has all the sameness of the desert without its dignity; the\\nfew towns and villages that break its monotony are mean and commonplace,\\nthere is nothing venerable about them, they have not even the\\npicturesqueness of poverty; indeed, Don Quixote\\'s own village,\\nArgamasilla, has a sort of oppressive respectability in the prim\\nregularity of its streets and houses; everything is ignoble; the very\\nwindmills are the ugliest and shabbiest of the windmill kind.',\n",
       " 'To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of \"Don\\nQuixote of La Mancha\" gave the key to the author\\'s meaning at once. La\\nMancha as the knight\\'s country and scene of his chivalries is of a piece\\nwith the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire,\\nknighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims of\\noppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote\\'s world\\nand the world he lived in, between things as he saw them and things as\\nthey were.',\n",
       " 'It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole\\nhumour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by the\\nmajority of those who have undertaken to interpret \"Don Quixote.\" It has\\nbeen completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure,\\nthe great majority of the artists who illustrated \"Don Quixote\" knew\\nnothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no idea but the\\nabstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do full\\njustice to the humour of Don Quixote\\'s misconception in taking it for a\\ncastle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal.\\nBut even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the\\nfull force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Dore\\'s drawing\\nof Don Quixote watching his armour in the inn-yard. Whether or not the\\nVenta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inn\\ndescribed in \"Don Quixote,\" beyond all question it was just such an\\ninn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his mind\\'s eye, and\\nit was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive\\ndraw-well in the corner that he meant Don Quixote to deposit his armour.\\nGustave Dore makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever\\nwatered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby\\nentirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic,\\ncommonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that\\ngives a significance to Don Quixote\\'s vigil and the ceremony that\\nfollows.',\n",
       " 'Cervantes\\' humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort,\\nthe strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is\\nthe incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the\\nideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and\\ntruth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous\\ncreation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which\\nCervantes was the first great master, \"Cervantes\\' serious air,\" which\\nsits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential\\nto this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the\\nhands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery\\nof Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent\\nCervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of\\nMotteux\\'s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French\\ntranslators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the\\nnarrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is\\nsaying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give\\nits peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the\\nexact opposite of the humour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists.\\nEven when Uncle Toby is at his best, you are always aware of \"the man\\nSterne\" behind him, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he\\nis producing. Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and\\nSancho. He and Swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out\\nof sight, or, more properly speaking, never think about themselves at\\nall, unlike our latter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived\\nthe old horse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque\\nassumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste.',\n",
       " 'It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other\\nlanguage is well-nigh an impossibility. There is a natural gravity and a\\nsonorous stateliness about Spanish, be it ever so colloquial, that make\\nan absurdity doubly absurd, and give plausibility to the most\\npreposterous statement. This is what makes Sancho Panza\\'s drollery the\\ndespair of the conscientious translator. Sancho\\'s curt comments can never\\nfall flat, but they lose half their flavour when transferred from their\\nnative Castilian into any other medium. But if foreigners have failed to\\ndo justice to the humour of Cervantes, they are no worse than his own\\ncountrymen. Indeed, were it not for the Spanish peasant\\'s relish of \"Don\\nQuixote,\" one might be tempted to think that the great humourist was not\\nlooked upon as a humourist at all in his own country.',\n",
       " 'The craze of Don Quixote seems, in some instances, to have communicated\\nitself to his critics, making them see things that are not in the book\\nand run full tilt at phantoms that have no existence save in their own\\nimaginations. Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that\\nscreams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are\\ninfluenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and\\npompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that\\nwhile they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of\\nimaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of\\nthe quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate\\nhighest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry.',\n",
       " 'To speak of \"Don Quixote\" as if it were merely a humorous book would be a\\nmanifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of\\ncommonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the\\nobservations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring\\nlife. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature.\\nAmong modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies\\nof character, but there is no book richer in individualised character.\\nWhat Coleridge said of Shakespeare in minimis is true of Cervantes; he\\nnever, even for the most temporary purpose, puts forward a lay figure.\\nThere is life and individuality in all his characters, however little\\nthey may have to do, or however short a time they may be before the\\nreader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the\\ntwo students met on the road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move\\nand have their being; and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of\\nCervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all. Even poor\\nMaritornes, with her deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and\\n\"some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her;\" and as for\\nSancho, though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him,\\nunless it be a sort of dog-like affection for his master, who is there\\nthat in his heart does not love him?',\n",
       " 'But it is, after all, the humour of \"Don Quixote\" that distinguishes it\\nfrom all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as\\none of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, \"the best\\nnovel in the world beyond all comparison.\" It is its varied humour,\\nranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare\\'s or\\nMoliere\\'s that has naturalised it in every country where there are\\nreaders, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature.',\n",

But I could not counteract Nature\\'s law\\nthat everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile,\\nilltilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical\\noffspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any\\nother imagination--just what might be begotten in a prison, where every\\nmisery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?\\nTranquillity, a cheerful retreat, pleasant fields, bright skies,\\nmurmuring brooks, peace of mind, these are the things that go far to make\\neven the most barren muses fertile, and bring into the world births that\\nfill it with wonder and delight. Sometimes when a father has an ugly,\\nloutish son, the love he bears him so blindfolds his eyes that he does\\nnot see his defects, or, rather, takes them for gifts and charms of mind\\nand body, and talks of them to his friends as wit and grace. I,\\nhowever--for though I pass for the father, I am but the stepfather to\\n\"Don Quixote\"--have no desire to go with the current of custom, or to\\nimplore thee, dearest reader, almost with tears in my eyes, as others do,\\nto pardon or excuse the defects thou wilt perceive in this child of mine.\\nThou art neither its kinsman nor its friend, thy soul is thine own and\\nthy will as free as any man\\'s, whate\\'er he be, thou art in thine own\\nhouse and master of it as much as the king of his taxes and thou knowest\\nthe common saying, \"Under my cloak I kill the king;\" all which exempts\\nand frees thee from every consideration and obligation, and thou canst\\nsay what thou wilt of the story without fear of being abused for any ill\\nor rewarded for any good thou mayest say of it.',\n",
       " 'My wish would be simply to present it to thee plain and unadorned,\\nwithout any embellishment of preface or uncountable muster of customary\\nsonnets, epigrams, and eulogies, such as are commonly put at the\\nbeginning of books. For I can tell thee, though composing it cost me some\\nlabour, I found none greater than the making of this Preface thou art now\\nreading. Many times did I take up my pen to write it, and many did I lay\\nit down again, not knowing what to write. One of these times, as I was\\npondering with the paper before me, a pen in my ear, my elbow on the\\ndesk, and my cheek in my hand, thinking of what I should say, there came\\nin unexpectedly a certain lively, clever friend of mine, who, seeing me\\nso deep in thought, asked the reason; to which I, making no mystery of\\nit, answered that I was thinking of the Preface I had to make for the\\nstory of \"Don Quixote,\" which so troubled me that I had a mind not to\\nmake any at all, nor even publish the achievements of so noble a knight.',\n",
       " '\"For, how could you expect me not to feel uneasy about what that ancient\\nlawgiver they call the Public will say when it sees me, after slumbering\\nso many years in the silence of oblivion, coming out now with all my\\nyears upon my back, and with a book as dry as a rush, devoid of\\ninvention, meagre in style, poor in thoughts, wholly wanting in learning\\nand wisdom, without quotations in the margin or annotations at the end,\\nafter the fashion of other books I see, which, though all fables and\\nprofanity, are so full of maxims from Aristotle, and Plato, and the whole\\nherd of philosophers, that they fill the readers with amazement and\\nconvince them that the authors are men of learning, erudition, and\\neloquence. And then, when they quote the Holy Scriptures!--anyone would\\nsay they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as\\nthey do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a\\ndistracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it\\nis a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this there will be\\nnothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note\\nat the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to\\nplace them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C,\\nbeginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis,\\nthough one was a slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do\\nwithout sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are\\ndukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets.

       " '\"Next, to prove yourself a man of erudition in polite literature and\\ncosmography, manage that the river Tagus shall be named in your story,\\nand there you are at once with another famous annotation, setting\\nforth--The river Tagus was so called after a King of Spain: it has its\\nsource in such and such a place and falls into the ocean, kissing the\\nwalls of the famous city of Lisbon, and it is a common belief that it has\\ngolden sands, etc. If you should have anything to do with robbers, I will\\ngive you the story of Cacus, for I have it by heart; if with loose women,\\nthere is the Bishop of Mondonedo, who will give you the loan of Lamia,\\nLaida, and Flora, any reference to whom will bring you great credit; if\\nwith hard-hearted ones, Ovid will furnish you with Medea; if with witches\\nor enchantresses, Homer has Calypso, and Virgil Circe; if with valiant\\ncaptains, Julius Caesar himself will lend you himself in his own\\n\\'Commentaries,\\' and Plutarch will give you a thousand Alexanders.

       " '\"Now let us come to those references to authors which other books have,\\nand you want for yours.

At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this\\nlong catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of\\nauthority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify\\nwhether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way\\nconcerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has\\nno need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from\\nbeginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which\\nAristotle never dreamt, nor St. Basil said a word, nor Cicero had any\\nknowledge; nor do the niceties of truth nor the observations of astrology\\ncome within the range of its fanciful vagaries; nor have geometrical\\nmeasurements or refutations of the arguments used in rhetoric anything to\\ndo with it; nor does it mean to preach to anybody, mixing up things human\\nand divine, a sort of motley in which no Christian understanding should\\ndress itself. It has only to avail itself of truth to nature in its\\ncomposition, and the more perfect the imitation the better the work will\\nbe. And as this piece of yours aims at nothing more than to destroy the\\nauthority and influence which books of chivalry have in the world and\\nwith the public, there is no need for you to go a-begging for aphorisms\\nfrom philosophers, precepts from Holy Scripture, fables from poets,\\nspeeches from orators, or miracles from saints; but merely to take care\\nthat your style and diction run musically, pleasantly, and plainly, with\\nclear, proper, and well-placed words, setting forth your purpose to the\\nbest of your power, and putting your ideas intelligibly, without\\nconfusion or obscurity. Strive, too, that in reading your story the\\nmelancholy may be moved to laughter, and the merry made merrier still;\\nthat the simple shall not be wearied, that the judicious shall admire the\\ninvention, that the grave shall not despise it, nor the wise fail to\\npraise it. Finally, keep your aim fixed on the destruction of that\\nill-founded edifice of the books of chivalry, hated by some and praised\\nby many more; for if you succeed in this you will have achieved no small\\nsuccess.\"',\n",

       " 'WHICH TREATS OF THE CHARACTER AND PURSUITS OF THE FAMOUS GENTLEMAN DON\\nQUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA',\n",
       " \"\\nIn a village of La Mancha, the name of which I have no desire to call to\\nmind, there lived not long since one of those gentlemen that keep a lance\\nin the lance-rack, an old buckler, a lean hack, and a greyhound for\\ncoursing. An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so extra\\non Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest of it\\nwent in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to match\\nfor holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his best\\nhomespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece under\\ntwenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to saddle the\\nhack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this gentleman of ours\\nwas bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit, spare, gaunt-featured, a\\nvery early riser and a great sportsman. They will have it his surname was\\nQuixada or Quesada (for here there is some difference of opinion among\\nthe authors who write on the subject), although from reasonable\\nconjectures it seems plain that he was called Quexana. This, however, is\\nof but little importance to our tale; it will be enough not to stray a\\nhair's breadth from the truth in the telling of it.\",\n",
       " 'You must know, then, that the above-named gentleman whenever he was at\\nleisure (which was mostly all the year round) gave himself up to reading\\nbooks of chivalry with such ardour and avidity that he almost entirely\\nneglected the pursuit of his field-sports, and even the management of his\\nproperty; and to such a pitch did his eagerness and infatuation go that\\nhe sold many an acre of tillageland to buy books of chivalry to read, and\\nbrought home as many of them as he could get. But of all there were none\\nhe liked so well as those of the famous Feliciano de Silva\\'s composition,\\nfor their lucidity of style and complicated conceits were as pearls in\\nhis sight, particularly when in his reading he came upon courtships and\\ncartels, where he often found passages like \"the reason of the unreason\\nwith which my reason is afflicted so weakens my reason that with reason I\\nmurmur at your beauty;\" or again, \"the high heavens, that of your\\ndivinity divinely fortify you with the stars, render you deserving of the\\ndesert your greatness deserves.\" Over conceits of this sort the poor\\ngentleman lost his wits, and used to lie awake striving to understand\\nthem and worm the meaning out of them; what Aristotle himself could not\\nhave made out or extracted had he come to life again for that special\\npurpose. He was not at all easy about the wounds which Don Belianis gave\\nand took, because it seemed to him that, great as were the surgeons who\\nhad cured him, he must have had his face and body covered all over with\\nseams and scars. He commended, however, the author\\'s way of ending his\\nbook with the promise of that interminable adventure, and many a time was\\nhe tempted to take up his pen and finish it properly as is there\\nproposed, which no doubt he would have done, and made a successful piece\\nof work of it too, had not greater and more absorbing thoughts prevented\\nhim.',\n",
       " 'Many an argument did he have with the curate of his village (a learned\\nman, and a graduate of Siguenza) as to which had been the better knight,\\nPalmerin of England or Amadis of Gaul. Master Nicholas, the village\\nbarber, however, used to say that neither of them came up to the Knight\\nof Phoebus, and that if there was any that could compare with him it was\\nDon Galaor, the brother of Amadis of Gaul, because he had a spirit that\\nwas equal to every occasion, and was no finikin knight, nor lachrymose\\nlike his brother, while in the matter of valour he was not a whit behind\\nhim. In short, he became so absorbed in his books that he spent his\\nnights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring\\nover them; and what with little sleep and much reading his brains got so\\ndry that he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read\\nabout in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds,\\nwooings, loves, agonies, and all sorts of impossible nonsense; and it so\\npossessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read\\nof was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it.\\nHe used to say the Cid Ruy Diaz was a very good knight, but that he was\\nnot to be compared with the Knight of the Burning Sword who with one\\nback-stroke cut in half two fierce and monstrous giants. He thought more\\nof Bernardo del Carpio because at Roncesvalles he slew Roland in spite of\\nenchantments, availing himself of the artifice of Hercules when he\\nstrangled Antaeus the son of Terra in his arms. He approved highly of the\\ngiant Morgante, because, although of the giant breed which is always\\narrogant and ill-conditioned, he alone was affable and well-bred. But\\nabove all he admired Reinaldos of Montalban, especially when he saw him\\nsallying forth from his castle and robbing everyone he met, and when\\nbeyond the seas he stole that image of Mahomet which, as his history\\nsays, was entirely of gold. To have a bout of kicking at that traitor of\\na Ganelon he would have given his housekeeper, and his niece into the\\nbargain.',\n",
       " 'In short, his wits being quite gone, he hit upon the strangest notion\\nthat ever madman in this world hit upon, and that was that he fancied it\\nwas right and requisite, as well for the support of his own honour as for\\nthe service of his country, that he should make a knight-errant of\\nhimself, roaming the world over in full armour and on horseback in quest\\nof adventures, and putting in practice himself all that he had read of as\\nbeing the usual practices of knights-errant; righting every kind of\\nwrong, and exposing himself to peril and danger from which, in the issue,\\nhe was to reap eternal renown and fame. Already the poor man saw himself\\ncrowned by the might of his arm Emperor of Trebizond at least; and so,\\nled away by the intense enjoyment he found in these pleasant fancies, he\\nset himself forthwith to put his scheme into execution.',\n",
       " 'The first thing he did was to clean up some armour that had belonged to\\nhis great-grandfather, and had been for ages lying forgotten in a corner\\neaten with rust and covered with mildew. He scoured and polished it as\\nbest he could, but he perceived one great defect in it, that it had no\\nclosed helmet, nothing but a simple morion. This deficiency, however, his\\ningenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet of pasteboard\\nwhich, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one. It is true that,\\nin order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a cut, he drew his\\nsword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of which undid in an\\ninstant what had taken him a week to do. The ease with which he had\\nknocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and to guard against that\\ndanger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron on the inside until he\\nwas satisfied with its strength; and then, not caring to try any more\\nexperiments with it, he passed it and adopted it as a helmet of the most\\nperfect construction.',\n",
       " 'He next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a\\nreal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \"tantum pellis et\\nossa fuit,\" surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or the\\nBabieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to give\\nhim, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse\\nbelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,\\nshould be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as\\nto indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and\\nwhat he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a\\nnew character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a\\ndistinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling\\nhe was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck out,\\nrejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his\\nmemory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to his\\nthinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack\\nbefore he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks\\nin the world.',\n",
       " 'Having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to\\nget one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this\\npoint, till at last he made up his mind to call himself \"Don Quixote,\"\\nwhence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history\\nhave inferred that his name must have been beyond a doubt Quixada, and\\nnot Quesada as others would have it. Recollecting, however, that the\\nvaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and nothing\\nmore, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it famous,\\nand called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight, resolved to\\nadd on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of La Mancha,\\nwhereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin and country,\\nand did honour to it in taking his surname from it.',\n",
       " 'So then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet, his\\nhack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the conclusion that\\nnothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady to be in love\\nwith; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree without leaves or\\nfruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to himself, \"If, for my sins,\\nor by my good fortune, I come across some giant hereabouts, a common\\noccurrence with knights-errant, and overthrow him in one onslaught, or\\ncleave him asunder to the waist, or, in short, vanquish and subdue him,\\nwill it not be well to have some one I may send him to as a present, that\\nhe may come in and fall on his knees before my sweet lady, and in a\\nhumble, submissive voice say, \\'I am the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the\\nisland of Malindrania, vanquished in single combat by the never\\nsufficiently extolled knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded\\nme to present myself before your Grace, that your Highness dispose of me\\nat your pleasure\\'?\" Oh, how our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of\\nthis speech, especially when he had thought of some one to call his Lady!\\nThere was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very\\ngood-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though,\\nso far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.\\nHer name was Aldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the\\ntitle of Lady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which\\nshould not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and\\nindicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her\\nDulcinea del Toboso--she being of El Toboso--a name, to his mind,\\nmusical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already\\nbestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.',\n",

       " '\\nThese preliminaries settled, he did not care to put off any longer the\\nexecution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world\\nwas losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,\\ngrievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties\\nto discharge. So, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and\\nwithout anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day\\n(which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he donned his suit of\\narmour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his\\nbuckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth\\nupon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with\\nwhat ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. But scarcely\\ndid he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck\\nhim, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very\\noutset. It occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that\\naccording to the law of chivalry he neither could nor ought to bear arms\\nagainst any knight; and that even if he had been, still he ought, as a\\nnovice knight, to wear white armour, without a device upon the shield\\nuntil by his prowess he had earned one. These reflections made him waver\\nin his purpose, but his craze being stronger than any reasoning, he made\\nup his mind to have himself dubbed a knight by the first one he came\\nacross, following the example of others in the same case, as he had read\\nin the books that brought him to this pass. As for white armour, he\\nresolved, on the first opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than\\nan ermine; and so comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that\\nwhich his horse chose, for in this he believed lay the essence of\\nadventures.',\n",
       " 'Thus setting out, our new-fledged adventurer paced along, talking to\\nhimself and saying, \"Who knows but that in time to come, when the\\nveracious history of my famous deeds is made known, the sage who writes\\nit, when he has to set forth my first sally in the early morning, will do\\nit after this fashion? \\'Scarce had the rubicund Apollo spread o\\'er the\\nface of the broad spacious earth the golden threads of his bright hair,\\nscarce had the little birds of painted plumage attuned their notes to\\nhail with dulcet and mellifluous harmony the coming of the rosy Dawn,\\nthat, deserting the soft couch of her jealous spouse, was appearing to\\nmortals at the gates and balconies of the Manchegan horizon, when the\\nrenowned knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, quitting the lazy down, mounted\\nhis celebrated steed Rocinante and began to traverse the ancient and\\nfamous Campo de Montiel;\\'\" which in fact he was actually traversing.\\n\"Happy the age, happy the time,\" he continued, \"in which shall be made\\nknown my deeds of fame, worthy to be moulded in brass, carved in marble,\\nlimned in pictures, for a memorial for ever. And thou, O sage magician,\\nwhoever thou art, to whom it shall fall to be the chronicler of this\\nwondrous history, forget not, I entreat thee, my good Rocinante, the\\nconstant companion of my ways and wanderings.\" Presently he broke out\\nagain, as if he were love-stricken in earnest, \"O Princess Dulcinea, lady\\nof this captive heart, a grievous wrong hast thou done me to drive me\\nforth with scorn, and with inexorable obduracy banish me from the\\npresence of thy beauty. O lady, deign to hold in remembrance this heart,\\nthy vassal, that thus in anguish pines for love of thee.\"',\n",
       " 'So he went on stringing together these and other absurdities, all in the\\nstyle of those his books had taught him, imitating their language as well\\nas he could; and all the while he rode so slowly and the sun mounted so\\nrapidly and with such fervour that it was enough to melt his brains if he\\nhad any. Nearly all day he travelled without anything remarkable\\nhappening to him, at which he was in despair, for he was anxious to\\nencounter some one at once upon whom to try the might of his strong arm.',\n",
       " \"Writers there are who say the first adventure he met with was that of\\nPuerto Lapice; others say it was that of the windmills; but what I have\\nascertained on this point, and what I have found written in the annals of\\nLa Mancha, is that he was on the road all day, and towards nightfall his\\nhack and he found themselves dead tired and hungry, when, looking all\\naround to see if he could discover any castle or shepherd's shanty where\\nhe might refresh himself and relieve his sore wants, he perceived not far\\nout of his road an inn, which was as welcome as a star guiding him to the\\nportals, if not the palaces, of his redemption; and quickening his pace\\nhe reached it just as night was setting in. At the door were standing two\\nyoung women, girls of the district as they call them, on their way to\\nSeville with some carriers who had chanced to halt that night at the inn;\\nand as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imaged\\nseemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,\\nthe moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its\\nfour turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the\\ndrawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of\\nthe sort. To this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at\\na short distance from it he checked Rocinante, hoping that some dwarf\\nwould show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give\\nnotice that a knight was approaching the castle. But seeing that they\\nwere slow about it, and that Rocinante was in a hurry to reach the\\nstable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who\\nwere standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or\\nlovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.\",\n",
       " 'At this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going through the\\nstubbles collecting a drove of pigs (for, without any apology, that is\\nwhat they are called) gave a blast of his horn to bring them together,\\nand forthwith it seemed to Don Quixote to be what he was expecting, the\\nsignal of some dwarf announcing his arrival; and so with prodigious\\nsatisfaction he rode up to the inn and to the ladies, who, seeing a man\\nof this sort approaching in full armour and with lance and buckler, were\\nturning in dismay into the inn, when Don Quixote, guessing their fear by\\ntheir flight, raising his pasteboard visor, disclosed his dry dusty\\nvisage, and with courteous bearing and gentle voice addressed them, \"Your\\nladyships need not fly or fear any rudeness, for that it belongs not to\\nthe order of knighthood which I profess to offer to anyone, much less to\\nhighborn maidens as your appearance proclaims you to be.\" The girls were\\nlooking at him and straining their eyes to make out the features which\\nthe clumsy visor obscured, but when they heard themselves called maidens,\\na thing so much out of their line, they could not restrain their\\nlaughter, which made Don Quixote wax indignant, and say, \"Modesty becomes\\nthe fair, and moreover laughter that has little cause is great silliness;\\nthis, however, I say not to pain or anger you, for my desire is none\\nother than to serve you.\"',\n",
       " 'The incomprehensible language and the unpromising looks of our cavalier\\nonly increased the ladies\\' laughter, and that increased his irritation,\\nand matters might have gone farther if at that moment the landlord had\\nnot come out, who, being a very fat man, was a very peaceful one. He,\\nseeing this grotesque figure clad in armour that did not match any more\\nthan his saddle, bridle, lance, buckler, or corselet, was not at all\\nindisposed to join the damsels in their manifestations of amusement; but,\\nin truth, standing in awe of such a complicated armament, he thought it\\nbest to speak him fairly, so he said, \"Senor Caballero, if your worship\\nwants lodging, bating the bed (for there is not one in the inn) there is\\nplenty of everything else here.\" Don Quixote, observing the respectful\\nbearing of the Alcaide of the fortress (for so innkeeper and inn seemed\\nin his eyes), made answer, \"Sir Castellan, for me anything will suffice,\\nfor',\n",
       " '\\'My armour is my only wear,\\nMy only rest the fray.\\'\"',\n",
       " 'The host fancied he called him Castellan because he took him for a\\n\"worthy of Castile,\" though he was in fact an Andalusian, and one from\\nthe strand of San Lucar, as crafty a thief as Cacus and as full of tricks\\nas a student or a page. \"In that case,\" said he,',\n",

       " 'and if so, you may dismount and safely reckon upon any quantity of\\nsleeplessness under this roof for a twelvemonth, not to say for a single\\nnight.\" So saying, he advanced to hold the stirrup for Don Quixote, who\\ngot down with great difficulty and exertion (for he had not broken his\\nfast all day), and then charged the host to take great care of his horse,\\nas he was the best bit of flesh that ever ate bread in this world. The\\nlandlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said,\\nnor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to\\nsee what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this\\ntime made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They\\nhad taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor\\nsaw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had\\nfastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots,\\nrequired to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to,\\nso he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and\\noddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his\\narmour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree\\nbelonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:',\n",

But to give him anything to drink was impossible, or would\\nhave been so had not the landlord bored a reed, and putting one end in\\nhis mouth poured the wine into him through the other; all which he bore\\nwith patience rather than sever the ribbons of his helmet.',\n",
       " 'While this was going on there came up to the inn a sowgelder, who, as he\\napproached, sounded his reed pipe four or five times, and thereby\\ncompletely convinced Don Quixote that he was in some famous castle, and\\nthat they were regaling him with music, and that the stockfish was trout,\\nthe bread the whitest, the wenches ladies, and the landlord the castellan\\nof the castle; and consequently he held that his enterprise and sally had\\nbeen to some purpose.

       " 'WHEREIN IS RELATED THE DROLL WAY IN WHICH DON QUIXOTE HAD HIMSELF DUBBED\\nA KNIGHT',\n",
       " '\\nHarassed by this reflection, he made haste with his scanty pothouse\\nsupper, and having finished it called the landlord, and shutting himself\\ninto the stable with him, fell on his knees before him, saying, \"From\\nthis spot I rise not, valiant knight, until your courtesy grants me the\\nboon I seek, one that will redound to your praise and the benefit of the\\nhuman race.\" The landlord, seeing his guest at his feet and hearing a\\nspeech of this kind, stood staring at him in bewilderment, not knowing\\nwhat to do or say, and entreating him to rise, but all to no purpose\\nuntil he had agreed to grant the boon demanded of him. \"I looked for no\\nless, my lord, from your High Magnificence,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and I\\nhave to tell you that the boon I have asked and your liberality has\\ngranted is that you shall dub me knight to-morrow morning, and that\\nto-night I shall watch my arms in the chapel of this your castle; thus\\ntomorrow, as I have said, will be accomplished what I so much desire,\\nenabling me lawfully to roam through all the four quarters of the world\\nseeking adventures on behalf of those in distress, as is the duty of\\nchivalry and of knights-errant like myself, whose ambition is directed to\\nsuch deeds.\"',\n",
       " \"The landlord, who, as has been mentioned, was something of a wag, and had\\nalready some suspicion of his guest's want of wits, was quite convinced\\nof it on hearing talk of this kind from him, and to make sport for the\\nnight he determined to fall in with his humour. So he told him he was\\nquite right in pursuing the object he had in view, and that such a motive\\nwas natural and becoming in cavaliers as distinguished as he seemed and\\nhis gallant bearing showed him to be; and that he himself in his younger\\ndays had followed the same honourable calling, roaming in quest of\\nadventures in various parts of the world, among others the Curing-grounds\\nof Malaga, the Isles of Riaran, the Precinct of Seville, the Little\\nMarket of Segovia, the Olivera of Valencia, the Rondilla of Granada, the\\nStrand of San Lucar, the Colt of Cordova, the Taverns of Toledo, and\\ndivers other quarters, where he had proved the nimbleness of his feet and\\nthe lightness of his fingers, doing many wrongs, cheating many widows,\\nruining maids and swindling minors, and, in short, bringing himself under\\nthe notice of almost every tribunal and court of justice in Spain; until\\nat last he had retired to this castle of his, where he was living upon\\nhis property and upon that of others; and where he received all\\nknights-errant of whatever rank or condition they might be, all for the\\ngreat love he bore them and that they might share their substance with\\nhim in return for his benevolence. He told him, moreover, that in this\\ncastle of his there was no chapel in which he could watch his armour, as\\nit had been pulled down in order to be rebuilt, but that in a case of\\nnecessity it might, he knew, be watched anywhere, and he might watch it\\nthat night in a courtyard of the castle, and in the morning, God willing,\\nthe requisite ceremonies might be performed so as to have him dubbed a\\nknight, and so thoroughly dubbed that nobody could be more so. He asked\\nif he had any money with him, to which Don Quixote replied that he had\\nnot a farthing, as in the histories of knights-errant he had never read\\nof any of them carrying any. On this point the landlord told him he was\\nmistaken; for, though not recorded in the histories, because in the\\nauthor's opinion there was no need to mention anything so obvious and\\nnecessary as money and clean shirts, it was not to be supposed therefore\\nthat they did not carry them, and he might regard it as certain and\\nestablished that all knights-errant (about whom there were so many full\\nand unimpeachable books) carried well-furnished purses in case of\\nemergency, and likewise carried shirts and a little box of ointment to\\ncure the wounds they received. For in those plains and deserts where they\\nengaged in combat and came out wounded, it was not always that there was\\nsome one to cure them, unless indeed they had for a friend some sage\\nmagician to succour them at once by fetching through the air upon a cloud\\nsome damsel or dwarf with a vial of water of such virtue that by tasting\\none drop of it they were cured of their hurts and wounds in an instant\\nand left as sound as if they had not received any damage whatever. But in\\ncase this should not occur, the knights of old took care to see that\\ntheir squires were provided with money and other requisites, such as lint\\nand ointments for healing purposes; and when it happened that knights had\\nno squires (which was rarely and seldom the case) they themselves carried\\neverything in cunning saddle-bags that were hardly seen on the horse's\\ncroup, as if it were something else of more importance, because, unless\\nfor some such reason, carrying saddle-bags was not very favourably\\nregarded among knights-errant. He therefore advised him (and, as his\\ngodson so soon to be, he might even command him) never from that time\\nforth to travel without money and the usual requirements, and he would\\nfind the advantage of them when he least expected it.\",\n",
       " 'Don Quixote promised to follow his advice scrupulously, and it was\\narranged forthwith that he should watch his armour in a large yard at one\\nside of the inn; so, collecting it all together, Don Quixote placed it on\\na trough that stood by the side of a well, and bracing his buckler on his\\narm he grasped his lance and began with a stately air to march up and\\ndown in front of the trough, and as he began his march night began to\\nfall.',\n",
       " 'The landlord told all the people who were in the inn about the craze of\\nhis guest, the watching of the armour, and the dubbing ceremony he\\ncontemplated. Full of wonder at so strange a form of madness, they\\nflocked to see it from a distance, and observed with what composure he\\nsometimes paced up and down, or sometimes, leaning on his lance, gazed on\\nhis armour without taking his eyes off it for ever so long; and as the\\nnight closed in with a light from the moon so brilliant that it might vie\\nwith his that lent it, everything the novice knight did was plainly seen\\nby all.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile one of the carriers who were in the inn thought fit to water\\nhis team, and it was necessary to remove Don Quixote\\'s armour as it lay\\non the trough; but he seeing the other approach hailed him in a loud\\nvoice, \"O thou, whoever thou art, rash knight that comest to lay hands on\\nthe armour of the most valorous errant that ever girt on sword, have a\\ncare what thou dost; touch it not unless thou wouldst lay down thy life\\nas the penalty of thy rashness.\" The carrier gave no heed to these words\\n(and he would have done better to heed them if he had been heedful of his\\nhealth), but seizing it by the straps flung the armour some distance from\\nhim. Seeing this, Don Quixote raised his eyes to heaven, and fixing his\\nthoughts, apparently, upon his lady Dulcinea, exclaimed, \"Aid me, lady\\nmine, in this the first encounter that presents itself to this breast\\nwhich thou holdest in subjection; let not thy favour and protection fail\\nme in this first jeopardy;\" and, with these words and others to the same\\npurpose, dropping his buckler he lifted his lance with both hands and\\nwith it smote such a blow on the carrier\\'s head that he stretched him on\\nthe ground, so stunned that had he followed it up with a second there\\nwould have been no need of a surgeon to cure him. This done, he picked up\\nhis armour and returned to his beat with the same serenity as before.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '\\nShortly after this, another, not knowing what had happened (for the\\ncarrier still lay senseless), came with the same object of giving water\\nto his mules, and was proceeding to remove the armour in order to clear\\nthe trough, when Don Quixote, without uttering a word or imploring aid\\nfrom anyone, once more dropped his buckler and once more lifted his\\nlance, and without actually breaking the second carrier\\'s head into\\npieces, made more than three of it, for he laid it open in four. At the\\nnoise all the people of the inn ran to the spot, and among them the\\nlandlord. Seeing this, Don Quixote braced his buckler on his arm, and\\nwith his hand on his sword exclaimed, \"O Lady of Beauty, strength and\\nsupport of my faint heart, it is time for thee to turn the eyes of thy\\ngreatness on this thy captive knight on the brink of so mighty an\\nadventure.\" By this he felt himself so inspired that he would not have\\nflinched if all the carriers in the world had assailed him. The comrades\\nof the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a distance\\nto shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best he could\\nwith his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his armour\\nunprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone, for he had\\nalready told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would not be\\naccountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don Quixote,\\ncalling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle, who allowed\\nknights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and a low-born\\nknight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he would call to\\naccount for his treachery. \"But of you,\" he cried, \"base and vile rabble,\\nI make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye can against me, ye\\nshall see what the reward of your folly and insolence will be.\" This he\\nuttered with so much spirit and boldness that he filled his assailants\\nwith a terrible fear, and as much for this reason as at the persuasion of\\nthe landlord they left off stoning him, and he allowed them to carry off\\nthe wounded, and with the same calmness and composure as before resumed\\nthe watch over his armour.',\n",
       " 'But these freaks of his guest were not much to the liking of the\\nlandlord, so he determined to cut matters short and confer upon him at\\nonce the unlucky order of knighthood before any further misadventure\\ncould occur; so, going up to him, he apologised for the rudeness which,\\nwithout his knowledge, had been offered to him by these low people, who,\\nhowever, had been well punished for their audacity. As he had already\\ntold him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was it needed\\nfor what remained to be done, for, as he understood the ceremonial of the\\norder, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay in the accolade and\\nin the slap on the shoulder, and that could be administered in the middle\\nof a field; and that he had now done all that was needful as to watching\\nthe armour, for all requirements were satisfied by a watch of two hours\\nonly, while he had been more than four about it. Don Quixote believed it\\nall, and told him he stood there ready to obey him, and to make an end of\\nit with as much despatch as possible; for, if he were again attacked, and\\nfelt himself to be dubbed knight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul\\nalive in the castle, except such as out of respect he might spare at his\\nbidding.',\n",
       " 'Thus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\\nwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\\ncarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\\nkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\\nsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand and\\ngave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a smart\\nslap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth as if he\\nwas saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of the ladies\\nto gird on his sword, which she did with great self-possession and\\ngravity, and not a little was required to prevent a burst of laughter at\\neach stage of the ceremony; but what they had already seen of the novice\\nknight\\'s prowess kept their laughter within bounds. On girding him with\\nthe sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May God make your worship a very\\nfortunate knight, and grant you success in battle.\" Don Quixote asked her\\nname in order that he might from that time forward know to whom he was\\nbeholden for the favour he had received, as he meant to confer upon her\\nsome portion of the honour he acquired by the might of his arm. She\\nanswered with great humility that she was called La Tolosa, and that she\\nwas the daughter of a cobbler of Toledo who lived in the stalls of\\nSanchobienaya, and that wherever she might be she would serve and esteem\\nhim as her lord. Don Quixote said in reply that she would do him a favour\\nif thenceforward she assumed the \"Don\" and called herself Dona Tolosa.\\nShe promised she would, and then the other buckled on his spur, and with\\nher followed almost the same conversation as with the lady of the sword.\\nHe asked her name, and she said it was La Molinera, and that she was the\\ndaughter of a respectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don\\nQuixote requested that she would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Dona\\nMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.',\n",
       " 'Having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\\nnever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\\nhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling\\nRocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned\\nthanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so\\nextraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.\\nThe landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric\\nthough with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the\\nreckoning let him go with a Godspeed.',\n",

However, recalling the advice of his host as\\nto the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring\\nto money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with\\nall, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a\\nfarm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very\\nwell qualified for the office of squire to a knight. With this object he\\nturned his horse's head towards his village, and Rocinante, thus reminded\\nof his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to\\ntread the earth.\",\n",
       " 'He had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to\\ncome feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard\\nthem he exclaimed, \"Thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,\\nthat it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation I\\nhave undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. These cries, no\\ndoubt, come from some man or woman in want of help, and needing my aid\\nand protection;\" and wheeling, he turned Rocinante in the direction\\nwhence the cries seemed to proceed. He had gone but a few paces into the\\nwood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and\\nstripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,\\nfrom whom the cries came. Nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer\\nwas flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings\\nand commands, repeating, \"Your mouth shut and your eyes open!\" while the\\nyouth made answer, \"I won\\'t do it again, master mine; by God\\'s passion I\\nwon\\'t do it again, and I\\'ll take more care of the flock another time.\"',\n",
       " 'Seeing what was going on, Don Quixote said in an angry voice,\\n\"Discourteous knight, it ill becomes you to assail one who cannot defend\\nhimself; mount your steed and take your lance\" (for there was a lance\\nleaning against the oak to which the mare was tied), \"and I will make you\\nknow that you are behaving as a coward.\" The farmer, seeing before him\\nthis figure in full armour brandishing a lance over his head, gave\\nhimself up for dead, and made answer meekly, \"Sir Knight, this youth that\\nI am chastising is my servant, employed by me to watch a flock of sheep\\nthat I have hard by, and he is so careless that I lose one every day, and\\nwhen I punish him for his carelessness and knavery he says I do it out of\\nniggardliness, to escape paying him the wages I owe him, and before God,\\nand on my soul, he lies.\"',\n",

       " '\"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes and the\\nblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him\\nwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid\\nfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood from\\nhim when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on that\\nscore he owes you nothing.\"',\n",

       " 'He now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he\\nwas reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to\\nconsider which road they should take. In imitation of them he halted for\\na while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave Rocinante his\\nhead, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his\\nfirst intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. After he\\nhad gone about two miles Don Quixote perceived a large party of people,\\nwho, as afterwards appeared, were some Toledo traders, on their way to\\nbuy silk at Murcia. There were six of them coming along under their\\nsunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.\\nScarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy possessed him that\\nthis must be some new adventure; and to help him to imitate as far as he\\ncould those passages he had read of in his books, here seemed to come one\\nmade on purpose, which he resolved to attempt. So with a lofty bearing\\nand determination he fixed himself firmly in his stirrups, got his lance\\nready, brought his buckler before his breast, and planting himself in the\\nmiddle of the road, stood waiting the approach of these knights-errant,\\nfor such he now considered and held them to be; and when they had come\\nnear enough to see and hear, he exclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All\\nthe world stand, unless all the world confess that in all the world there\\nis no maiden fairer than the Empress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea\\ndel Toboso.\"',\n",

       " '\"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would\\nyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that\\nwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend\\nit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant\\nrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of knighthood\\nrequires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of your breed,\\nhere do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the cause I\\nmaintain.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sir Knight,\" replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name of\\nthis present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our\\nconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\\nof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and Queens\\nof the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to show us\\nsome portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain of wheat;\\nfor by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we shall be\\nsatisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay, I believe\\nwe are already so far agreed with you that even though her portrait\\nshould show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and sulphur\\nfrom the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship, say all\\nin her favour that you desire.\"',\n",

       " '\\nAt this instant Don Quixote began shouting out, \"Here, here, valiant\\nknights! here is need for you to put forth the might of your strong arms,\\nfor they of the Court are gaining the mastery in the tourney!\" Called\\naway by this noise and outcry, they proceeded no farther with the\\nscrutiny of the remaining books, and so it is thought that \"The Carolea,\"\\n\"The Lion of Spain,\" and \"The Deeds of the Emperor,\" written by Don Luis\\nde Avila, went to the fire unseen and unheard; for no doubt they were\\namong those that remained, and perhaps if the curate had seen them they\\nwould not have undergone so severe a sentence.',\n",
       " 'When they reached Don Quixote he was already out of bed, and was still\\nshouting and raving, and slashing and cutting all round, as wide awake as\\nif he had never slept.',\n",
       " 'They closed with him and by force got him back to bed, and when he had\\nbecome a little calm, addressing the curate, he said to him, \"Of a truth,\\nSenor Archbishop Turpin, it is a great disgrace for us who call ourselves\\nthe Twelve Peers, so carelessly to allow the knights of the Court to gain\\nthe victory in this tourney, we the adventurers having carried off the\\nhonour on the three former days.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hush, gossip,\" said the curate; \"please God, the luck may turn, and what\\nis lost to-day may be won to-morrow; for the present let your worship\\nhave a care of your health, for it seems to me that you are\\nover-fatigued, if not badly wounded.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wounded no,\" said Don Quixote, \"but bruised and battered no doubt, for\\nthat bastard Don Roland has cudgelled me with the trunk of an oak tree,\\nand all for envy, because he sees that I alone rival him in his\\nachievements. But I should not call myself Reinaldos of Montalvan did he\\nnot pay me for it in spite of all his enchantments as soon as I rise from\\nthis bed. For the present let them bring me something to eat, for that, I\\nfeel, is what will be more to my purpose, and leave it to me to avenge\\nmyself.\"',\n",
       " 'They did as he wished; they gave him something to eat, and once more he\\nfell asleep, leaving them marvelling at his madness.',\n",
       " 'That night the housekeeper burned to ashes all the books that were in the\\nyard and in the whole house; and some must have been consumed that\\ndeserved preservation in everlasting archives, but their fate and the\\nlaziness of the examiner did not permit it, and so in them was verified\\nthe proverb that the innocent suffer for the guilty.',\n",
       " \"One of the remedies which the curate and the barber immediately applied\\nto their friend's disorder was to wall up and plaster the room where the\\nbooks were, so that when he got up he should not find them (possibly the\\ncause being removed the effect might cease), and they might say that a\\nmagician had carried them off, room and all; and this was done with all\\ndespatch. Two days later Don Quixote got up, and the first thing he did\\nwas to go and look at his books, and not finding the room where he had\\nleft it, he wandered from side to side looking for it. He came to the\\nplace where the door used to be, and tried it with his hands, and turned\\nand twisted his eyes in every direction without saying a word; but after\\na good while he asked his housekeeper whereabouts was the room that held\\nhis books.\",\n",
       " 'The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to\\nanswer, said, \"What room or what nothing is it that your worship is\\nlooking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the\\ndevil himself has carried all away.\"',\n",
       " '\"It was not the devil,\" said the niece, \"but a magician who came on a\\ncloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting\\nfrom a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I\\nknow not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof,\\nand left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had\\ndone we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the\\nhousekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice\\nthat, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room,\\nhe had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he\\nsaid too that his name was the Sage Munaton.\"',\n",
       " '\"He must have said Friston,\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\" said the\\nhousekeeper, \"I only know that his name ended with \\'ton.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"So it does,\" said Don Quixote, \"and he is a sage magician, a great enemy\\nof mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore\\nthat in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight\\nwhom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to\\nprevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns\\nthat he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid\\nwhat is decreed by Heaven.\"',\n",
       " '\"Who doubts that?\" said the niece; \"but, uncle, who mixes you up in these\\nquarrels? Would it not be better to remain at peace in your own house\\ninstead of roaming the world looking for better bread than ever came of\\nwheat, never reflecting that many go for wool and come back shorn?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, niece of mine,\" replied Don Quixote, \"how much astray art thou in\\nthy reckoning: ere they shear me I shall have plucked away and stripped\\noff the beards of all who dare to touch only the tip of a hair of mine.\"',\n",
       " 'The two were unwilling to make any further answer, as they saw that his\\nanger was kindling.',\n",
       " 'In short, then, he remained at home fifteen days very quietly without\\nshowing any signs of a desire to take up with his former delusions, and\\nduring this time he held lively discussions with his two gossips, the\\ncurate and the barber, on the point he maintained, that knights-errant\\nwere what the world stood most in need of, and that in him was to be\\naccomplished the revival of knight-errantry. The curate sometimes\\ncontradicted him, sometimes agreed with him, for if he had not observed\\nthis precaution he would have been unable to bring him to reason.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile Don Quixote worked upon a farm labourer, a neighbour of his, an\\nhonest man (if indeed that title can be given to him who is poor), but\\nwith very little wit in his pate. In a word, he so talked him over, and\\nwith such persuasions and promises, that the poor clown made up his mind\\nto sally forth with him and serve him as esquire. Don Quixote, among\\nother things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly,\\nbecause any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in\\nthe twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the\\nlike promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and\\nchildren, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and\\npawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together\\na fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan\\nfrom a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he\\nwarned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he\\nmight provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he\\ncharged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that\\nhe meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to\\ngoing on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying\\nwhether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an\\nesquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For\\nall that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him\\nwith a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by\\nappropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered.\\nHimself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could,\\naccording to the advice the host had given him; all which being done,\\nwithout taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don\\nQuixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by\\nanybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course\\nof it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even\\nshould search be made for them.',\n",
       " 'Sancho rode on his ass like a patriarch, with his alforjas and bota, and\\nlonging to see himself soon governor of the island his master had\\npromised him. Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road he\\nhad taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel, which he\\ntravelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for, as it was\\nearly morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely, the heat\\ndid not distress them.',\n",
       " 'And now said Sancho Panza to his master, \"Your worship will take care,\\nSenor Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised me,\\nfor be it ever so big I\\'ll be equal to governing it.\"',\n",
       " 'To which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza, that\\nit was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of old to\\nmake their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they won, and I\\nam determined that there shall be no failure on my part in so liberal a\\ncustom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for they sometimes,\\nand perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires were old, and\\nthen when they had had enough of service and hard days and worse nights,\\nthey gave them some title or other, of count, or at the most marquis, of\\nsome valley or province more or less; but if thou livest and I live, it\\nmay well be that before six days are over, I may have won some kingdom\\nthat has others dependent upon it, which will be just the thing to enable\\nthee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor needst thou count this\\nwonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways\\nso unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than\\nI promise thee.\"',\n",
       " '\"In that case,\" said Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of\\nthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old\\nwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded\\nthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them\\nwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, senor, she is not\\nworth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that\\nonly with God\\'s help.\"',\n",
       " '\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give her\\nwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to\\nbe content with anything less than being governor of a province.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will not, senor,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of such\\nquality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all\\nthat will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\"',\n",

       " 'OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND\\nUNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO\\nBE FITLY RECORDED',\n",
       " '\\nAt this point they came in sight of thirty forty windmills that there are\\non plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire,\\n\"Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our\\ndesires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or\\nmore monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in\\nbattle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our\\nfortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\\'s good service to\\nsweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\"',\n",
       " '\"What giants?\" said Sancho Panza.',\n",
       " '\"Those thou seest there,\" answered his master, \"with the long arms, and\\nsome have them nearly two leagues long.\"',\n",
       " '\"Look, your worship,\" said Sancho; \"what we see there are not giants but\\nwindmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by\\nthe wind make the millstone go.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is easy to see,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that thou art not used to this\\nbusiness of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away\\nwith thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in\\nfierce and unequal combat.\"',\n",
       " 'So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries\\nhis squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they\\nwere windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so\\npositive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor\\nperceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting,\\n\"Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\"',\n",
       " 'A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to\\nmove, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, \"Though ye flourish more arms\\nthan the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\"',\n",
       " \"So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady\\nDulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in\\nrest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop\\nand fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove\\nhis lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force\\nthat it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider,\\nwho went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened\\nto his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found\\nhim unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.\",\n",
       " '\"God bless me!\" said Sancho, \"did I not tell your worship to mind what\\nyou were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made\\nany mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his\\nhead.\"',\n",
       " '\"Hush, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"the fortunes of war more\\nthan any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover I think,\\nand it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study\\nand books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the\\nglory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end\\nhis wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\"',\n",
       " '\"God order it as he may,\" said Sancho Panza, and helping him to rise got\\nhim up again on Rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,\\ndiscussing the late adventure, they followed the road to Puerto Lapice,\\nfor there, said Don Quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in\\nabundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. For all that, he\\nwas much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,\\nhe added, \"I remember having read how a Spanish knight, Diego Perez de\\nVargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a\\nponderous bough or branch, and with it did such things that day, and\\npounded so many Moors, that he got the surname of Machuca, and he and his\\ndescendants from that day forth were called Vargas y Machuca. I mention\\nthis because from the first oak I see I mean to rend such another branch,\\nlarge and stout like that, with which I am determined and resolved to do\\nsuch deeds that thou mayest deem thyself very fortunate in being found\\nworthy to come and see them, and be an eyewitness of things that will\\nwith difficulty be believed.\"',\n",
       " '\"Be that as God will,\" said Sancho, \"I believe it all as your worship\\nsays it; but straighten yourself a little, for you seem all on one side,\\nmay be from the shaking of the fall.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if I make no complaint of the\\npain it is because knights-errant are not permitted to complain of any\\nwound, even though their bowels be coming out through it.\"',\n",
       " '\"If so,\" said Sancho, \"I have nothing to say; but God knows I would\\nrather your worship complained when anything ailed you. For my part, I\\nconfess I must complain however small the ache may be; unless this rule\\nabout not complaining extends to the squires of knights-errant also.\"',\n",
       " \"Don Quixote could not help laughing at his squire's simplicity, and he\\nassured him he might complain whenever and however he chose, just as he\\nliked, for, so far, he had never read of anything to the contrary in the\\norder of knighthood.\",\n",
       " 'Sancho bade him remember it was dinner-time, to which his master answered\\nthat he wanted nothing himself just then, but that he might eat when he\\nhad a mind. With this permission Sancho settled himself as comfortably as\\nhe could on his beast, and taking out of the alforjas what he had stowed\\naway in them, he jogged along behind his master munching deliberately,\\nand from time to time taking a pull at the bota with a relish that the\\nthirstiest tapster in Malaga might have envied; and while he went on in\\nthis way, gulping down draught after draught, he never gave a thought to\\nany of the promises his master had made him, nor did he rate it as\\nhardship but rather as recreation going in quest of adventures, however\\ndangerous they might be. Finally they passed the night among some trees,\\nfrom one of which Don Quixote plucked a dry branch to serve him after a\\nfashion as a lance, and fixed on it the head he had removed from the\\nbroken one. All that night Don Quixote lay awake thinking of his lady\\nDulcinea, in order to conform to what he had read in his books, how many\\na night in the forests and deserts knights used to lie sleepless\\nsupported by the memory of their mistresses. Not so did Sancho Panza\\nspend it, for having his stomach full of something stronger than chicory\\nwater he made but one sleep of it, and, if his master had not called him,\\nneither the rays of the sun beating on his face nor all the cheery notes\\nof the birds welcoming the approach of day would have had power to waken\\nhim. On getting up he tried the bota and found it somewhat less full than\\nthe night before, which grieved his heart because they did not seem to be\\non the way to remedy the deficiency readily. Don Quixote did not care to\\nbreak his fast, for, as has been already said, he confined himself to\\nsavoury recollections for nourishment.',\n",
       " 'They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto\\nLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \"Here,\\nbrother Sancho Panza,\" said Don Quixote when he saw it, \"we may plunge\\nour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,\\neven shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou must\\nnot put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou perceivest\\nthat those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in that case thou\\nmayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it is on no account\\npermitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to help me until thou\\nhast been dubbed a knight.\"',\n",
       " '\"Most certainly, senor,\" replied Sancho, \"your worship shall be fully\\nobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no\\nfriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\\ndefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for\\nlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any\\nassailant whatever.\"',\n",
       " '\"That I grant,\" said Don Quixote, \"but in this matter of aiding me\\nagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural impetuosity.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will do so, I promise you,\" answered Sancho, \"and will keep this\\nprecept as carefully as Sunday.\"',\n",
       " 'While they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of the\\norder of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less tall were\\nthe two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles and carried\\nsunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or five persons\\non horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there was, as\\nafterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where her\\nhusband was about to take passage for the Indies with an appointment of\\nhigh honour. The friars, though going the same road, were not in her\\ncompany; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he said to his squire,\\n\"Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the most famous adventure\\nthat has ever been seen, for those black bodies we see there must be, and\\ndoubtless are, magicians who are carrying off some stolen princess in\\nthat coach, and with all my might I must undo this wrong.\"',\n",
       " '\"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \"Look, senor; those\\nare friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\\ntravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don\\'t let the\\ndevil mislead you.\"',\n",
       " '\"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that on the\\nsubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\\nthou shalt see presently.\"',\n",
       " 'So saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road along\\nwhich the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had come\\nnear enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and unnatural\\nbeings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you are carrying\\noff by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy death as the\\njust punishment of your evil deeds.\"',\n",
       " 'The friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don Quixote\\nas well as at his words, to which they replied, \"Senor Caballero, we are\\nnot devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St. Benedict following our\\nroad, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses\\ncoming in this coach.\"',\n",
       " '\"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" said Don Quixote,\\nand without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with levelled\\nlance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if\\nthe friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him\\nto the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.\\nThe second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels\\ninto his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the\\nwind.',\n",
       " 'Sancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly\\nfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At that\\ninstant the friars muleteers came up and asked what he was stripping him\\nfor. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully as spoil of the\\nbattle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The muleteers, who had no idea\\nof a joke and did not understand all this about battles and spoils,\\nseeing that Don Quixote was some distance off talking to the travellers\\nin the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him down, and leaving hardly a\\nhair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks and left him stretched\\nbreathless and senseless on the ground; and without any more delay helped\\nthe friar to mount, who, trembling, terrified, and pale, as soon as he\\nfound himself in the saddle, spurred after his companion, who was\\nstanding at a distance looking on, watching the result of the onslaught;\\nthen, not caring to wait for the end of the affair just begun, they\\npursued their journey making more crosses than if they had the devil\\nafter them.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\\n\"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he, \"may now dispose of your person as may\\nbe most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers\\nlies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest\\nyou should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that I am\\ncalled Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and\\ncaptive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del Toboso: and in\\nreturn for the service you have received of me I ask no more than that\\nyou should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before\\nthat lady and tell her what I have done to set you free.\"',\n",
       " 'One of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\\nlistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\\nnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to El\\nToboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\\nCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \"Begone, caballero, and\\nill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\\nslayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\"',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly, \"If\\nthou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already chastised thy\\nfolly and rashness, miserable creature.\" To which the Biscayan returned,\\n\"I no gentleman!--I swear to God thou liest as I am Christian: if thou\\ndroppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou see thou art carrying\\nwater to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at sea, hidalgo at the devil,\\nand look, if thou sayest otherwise thou liest.\"',\n",
       " '\"\\'\"You will see presently,\" said Agrajes,\\'\" replied Don Quixote; and\\nthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler on\\nhis arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.',\n",
       " 'The Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\\nfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for hire,\\nhe had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was lucky\\nfor him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was able to\\nsnatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at one\\nanother as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove to make\\npeace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in his\\ndisjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he would\\nkill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The lady in\\nthe coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the coachman to\\ndraw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe struggle, in\\nthe course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a mighty stroke on the\\nshoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given to one without armour,\\nwould have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote, feeling the weight of\\nthis prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \"O lady of my soul, Dulcinea,\\nflower of beauty, come to the aid of this your knight, who, in fulfilling\\nhis obligations to your beauty, finds himself in this extreme peril.\" To\\nsay this, to lift his sword, to shelter himself well behind his buckler,\\nand to assail the Biscayan was the work of an instant, determined as he\\nwas to venture all upon a single blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on\\nin this way, was convinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and\\nresolved to follow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under\\ncover of his cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with\\nhis mule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\\nnot stir a step.',\n",
       " 'On, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan, with\\nuplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half, while on\\nhis side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under the\\nprotection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting in\\nsuspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the lady in\\nthe coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand vows and\\nofferings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God might deliver\\nher squire and all of them from this great peril in which they found\\nthemselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis the author\\nof the history leaves this battle impending, giving as excuse that he\\ncould find nothing more written about these achievements of Don Quixote\\nthan what has been already set forth. It is true the second author of\\nthis work was unwilling to believe that a history so curious could have\\nbeen allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion, or that the wits of\\nLa Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to preserve in their\\narchives or registries some documents referring to this famous knight;\\nand this being his persuasion, he did not despair of finding the\\nconclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven favouring him, he did\\nfind in a way that shall be related in the Second Part.',\n",

       " 'In the First Part of this history we left the valiant Biscayan and the\\nrenowned Don Quixote with drawn swords uplifted, ready to deliver two\\nsuch furious slashing blows that if they had fallen full and fair they\\nwould at least have split and cleft them asunder from top to toe and laid\\nthem open like a pomegranate; and at this so critical point the\\ndelightful history came to a stop and stood cut short without any\\nintimation from the author where what was missing was to be found.',\n",
       " 'This distressed me greatly, because the pleasure derived from having read\\nsuch a small portion turned to vexation at the thought of the poor chance\\nthat presented itself of finding the large part that, so it seemed to me,\\nwas missing of such an interesting tale. It appeared to me to be a thing\\nimpossible and contrary to all precedent that so good a knight should\\nhave been without some sage to undertake the task of writing his\\nmarvellous achievements; a thing that was never wanting to any of those\\nknights-errant who, they say, went after adventures; for every one of\\nthem had one or two sages as if made on purpose, who not only recorded\\ntheir deeds but described their most trifling thoughts and follies,\\nhowever secret they might be; and such a good knight could not have been\\nso unfortunate as not to have what Platir and others like him had in\\nabundance. And so I could not bring myself to believe that such a gallant\\ntale had been left maimed and mutilated, and I laid the blame on Time,\\nthe devourer and destroyer of all things, that had either concealed or\\nconsumed it.',\n",
       " 'On the other hand, it struck me that, inasmuch as among his books there\\nhad been found such modern ones as \"The Enlightenment of Jealousy\" and\\nthe \"Nymphs and Shepherds of Henares,\" his story must likewise be modern,\\nand that though it might not be written, it might exist in the memory of\\nthe people of his village and of those in the neighbourhood. This\\nreflection kept me perplexed and longing to know really and truly the\\nwhole life and wondrous deeds of our famous Spaniard, Don Quixote of La\\nMancha, light and mirror of Manchegan chivalry, and the first that in our\\nage and in these so evil days devoted himself to the labour and exercise\\nof the arms of knight-errantry, righting wrongs, succouring widows, and\\nprotecting damsels of that sort that used to ride about, whip in hand, on\\ntheir palfreys, with all their virginity about them, from mountain to\\nmountain and valley to valley--for, if it were not for some ruffian, or\\nboor with a hood and hatchet, or monstrous giant, that forced them, there\\nwere in days of yore damsels that at the end of eighty years, in all\\nwhich time they had never slept a day under a roof, went to their graves\\nas much maids as the mothers that bore them. I say, then, that in these\\nand other respects our gallant Don Quixote is worthy of everlasting and\\nnotable praise, nor should it be withheld even from me for the labour and\\npains spent in searching for the conclusion of this delightful history;\\nthough I know well that if Heaven, chance and good fortune had not helped\\nme, the world would have remained deprived of an entertainment and\\npleasure that for a couple of hours or so may well occupy him who shall\\nread it attentively. The discovery of it occurred in this way.',\n",
       " 'One day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some\\npamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading\\neven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent of\\nmine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw that it\\nwas in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was unable to\\nread them though I could recognise them, I looked about to see if there\\nwere any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for me; nor was\\nthere any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter, for even had I\\nsought one for an older and better language I should have found him. In\\nshort, chance provided me with one, who when I told him what I wanted and\\nput the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a\\nlittle in it began to laugh. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he\\nreplied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by\\nway of a note. I bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, \"In\\nthe margin, as I told you, this is written: \\'This Dulcinea del Toboso so\\noften mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any\\nwoman in all La Mancha for salting pigs.\\'\"',\n",
       " 'When I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and\\namazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained\\nthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the\\nbeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he\\ntold me it meant, \"History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cide\\nHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian.\" It required great caution to hide\\nthe joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and snatching\\nit from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and pamphlets from the\\nboy for half a real; and if he had had his wits about him and had known\\nhow eager I was for them, he might have safely calculated on making more\\nthan six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at once with the Morisco into\\nthe cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets\\nthat related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting\\nor adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He\\nwas satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and\\npromised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make\\nthe matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I\\ntook him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he\\ntranslated the whole just as it is set down here.',\n",
       " 'In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was\\ndrawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history\\ndescribes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the\\nother by his cushion, and the Biscayan\\'s mule so true to nature that it\\ncould be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The Biscayan had an\\ninscription under his feet which said, \"Don Sancho de Azpeitia,\" which no\\ndoubt must have been his name; and at the feet of Rocinante was another\\nthat said, \"Don Quixote.\" Rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long\\nand thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in\\nconsumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the\\nname of Rocinante had been bestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza\\nholding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,\\n\"Sancho Zancas,\" and according to the picture, he must have had a big\\nbelly, a short body, and long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the\\nnames of Panza and Zancas were given him, for by these two surnames the\\nhistory several times calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be\\nmentioned, but they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do\\nwith the true relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long\\nas it is true.',\n",
       " 'If against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its\\ntruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very\\ncommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather than\\nadditions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion; for,\\nwhere he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so worthy\\na knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in silence; which\\nis ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business and duty of\\nhistorians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from passion, and\\nneither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make them swerve from\\nthe path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of time, storehouse of\\ndeeds, witness for the past, example and counsel for the present, and\\nwarning for the future. In this I know will be found all that can be\\ndesired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting in any good quality, I\\nmaintain it is the fault of its hound of an author and not the fault of\\nthe subject. To be brief, its Second Part, according to the translation,\\nbegan in this way:',\n",
       " 'With trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though\\nthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and\\nearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear\\nthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which was\\ndelivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in its\\ncourse, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the\\nbitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good\\nfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword of\\nhis adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder, it\\ndid him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour, carrying\\naway a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all which with\\nfearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry plight.',\n",
       " 'Good God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that filled\\nthe heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in this\\nfashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised\\nhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both\\nhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full over\\nthe cushion and over the head, that--even so good a shield proving\\nuseless--as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from nose,\\nmouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his mule, as\\nno doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about its neck; at\\nthe same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the stirrups and then\\nunclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at the terrible blow,\\nmade off across the plain, and with a few plunges flung its master to the\\nground. Don Quixote stood looking on very calmly, and, when he saw him\\nfall, leaped from his horse and with great briskness ran to him, and,\\npresenting the point of his sword to his eyes, bade him surrender, or he\\nwould cut his head off. The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable\\nto answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don\\nQuixote, had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching\\nthe combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him\\nwith earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of\\nsparing their squire\\'s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much\\ngravity and dignity, \"In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what\\nye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is\\nthat this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my\\nbehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal\\nwith him as shall be most pleasing to her.\"',\n",

Seeing, therefore, that the struggle\\nwas now over, and that his master was returning to mount Rocinante, he\\napproached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he\\nwent on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, \"May\\nit please your worship, Senor Don Quixote, to give me the government of\\nthat island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big\\nI feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as\\nwell as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands.\"',\n",
       " 'To which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must take notice, brother Sancho,\\nthat this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but\\nof cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear\\nthe less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from\\nwhich I may make you, not only a governor, but something more.\"',\n",

Sancho followed him at his ass\\'s\\nbest trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind,\\nhe was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so,\\nreining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him\\nsaid, \"It seems to me, senor, it would be prudent in us to go and take\\nrefuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has\\nbeen left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to\\nthe Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we\\ncome out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\"',\n",

       " '\"I know nothing about omecils,\" answered Sancho, \"nor in my life have had\\nanything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks\\nafter those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not\\nmeddle.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for\\nI will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of\\nthose of the Brotherhood.

       " '\"The truth is,\" answered Sancho, \"that I have never read any history, for\\nI can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a\\nmore daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days\\nof my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have\\nsaid; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal\\nof blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little\\nwhite ointment in the alforjas.\"',\n",

In that blessed age all things were\\nin common; to win the daily food no labour was required of any save to\\nstretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks that stood\\ngenerously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The clear streams\\nand running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in noble\\nabundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in the clefts\\nof the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without usance the\\nplenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The mighty cork\\ntrees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the broad light bark\\nthat served at first to roof the houses supported by rude stakes, a\\nprotection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then all was peace,\\nall friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of the crooked plough\\nhad not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels of our first mother\\nthat without compulsion yielded from every portion of her broad fertile\\nbosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight the children that then\\npossessed her. Then was it that the innocent and fair young shepherdess\\nroamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with flowing locks, and no\\nmore garments than were needful modestly to cover what modesty seeks and\\never sought to hide.

Justice held her ground, undisturbed and unassailed\\nby the efforts of favour and of interest, that now so much impair,\\npervert, and beset her. Arbitrary law had not yet established itself in\\nthe mind of the judge, for then there was no cause to judge and no one to\\nbe judged. Maidens and modesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone\\nand unattended, without fear of insult from lawlessness or libertine\\nassault, and if they were undone it was of their own will and pleasure.\\nBut now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not though some new\\nlabyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even there the\\npestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on\\nthe air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all\\nseclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and\\nwickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to\\ndefend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the\\nneedy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks\\nfor the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for\\nthough by natural law all living are bound to show favour to\\nknights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have\\nwelcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my\\npower I should thank you for yours.\"',\n",

       " '\"For all that, we thank thee,\" answered Pedro.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the\\nshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead\\nman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,\\nwho had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\\nhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned and\\ndeeply read. \"Above all, they said, he was learned in the science of the\\nstars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and the moon,\\nfor he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact time.\"',\n",
       " '\"Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\\nluminaries,\" said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\\ntrifles, went on with his story, saying, \"Also he foretold when the year\\nwas going to be one of abundance or estility.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sterility, you mean,\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"Sterility or estility,\" answered Pedro, \"it is all the same in the end.\\nAnd I can tell you that by this his father and friends who believed him\\ngrew very rich because they did as he advised them, bidding them \\'sow\\nbarley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow pulse and not barley;\\nthe next there will be a full oil crop, and the three following not a\\ndrop will be got.\\'\"',\n",
       " '\"That science is called astrology,\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I do not know what it is called,\" replied Pedro, \"but I know that he\\nknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months had\\npassed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared dressed\\nas a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the long gown\\nhe wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend, Ambrosio by\\nname, who had been his companion in his studies, took to the shepherd\\'s\\ndress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great\\nman for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve,\\nand plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted,\\nand all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the two scholars\\nso unexpectedly appearing in shepherd\\'s dress, they were lost in wonder,\\nand could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change.\\nAbout this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir\\nto a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small\\nnumber of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the\\nyoung man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it\\nall, for he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of\\nworthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came\\nto be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to\\nwander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad\\nmentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in\\nlove. And I must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who\\nthis girl is; perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have\\nheard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live\\nmore years than sarna.\"',\n",
       " '\"Say Sarra,\" said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd\\'s confusion\\nof words.',\n",
       " '\"The sarna lives long enough,\" answered Pedro; \"and if, senor, you must\\ngo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it\\nthis twelvemonth.\"',\n",
       " '\"Pardon me, friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, as there is such a\\ndifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\\nanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\\nyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.\"',\n",
       " '\"I say then, my dear sir,\" said the goatherd, \"that in our village there\\nwas a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named\\nGuillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a\\ndaughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected woman there\\nwas in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that\\ncountenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and\\nmoreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the\\npresent moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other world. Her\\nhusband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving\\nhis daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers,\\na priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty\\nthat it reminded us of her mother\\'s, which was very great, and yet it was\\nthought that the daughter\\'s would exceed it; and so when she reached the\\nage of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that\\nhad made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her\\npast redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement,\\nbut for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for\\nit as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and\\nimportuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of\\nthose many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them.\\nBut he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in\\nmarriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so\\nwithout her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which\\nthe custody of the girl\\'s property brought him while he put off her\\nmarriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more\\nthan one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in\\nthese little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped\\nat, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above\\ngood who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in\\nvillages.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote; \"but go on, for the story is very\\ngood, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\"',\n",
       " '\"May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\" said Pedro; \"that is the one\\nto have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his\\nniece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the\\nmany who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a\\nchoice according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than\\nthat she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did\\nnot think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all\\nappearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge\\nher, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate\\nherself to her own liking. For, said he--and he said quite right--parents\\nare not to settle children in life against their will. But when one least\\nlooked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes her\\nappearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those\\nof the town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the\\nother shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so,\\nsince she appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I\\ncould not well tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants,\\nhave adopted the costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making\\nlove to her. One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased\\nfriend, of whom they say that he did not love but adore her. But you must\\nnot suppose, because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and\\nindependence, and of so little or rather no retirement, that she has\\ngiven any occasion, or even the semblance of one, for disparagement of\\nher purity and modesty; on the contrary, such and so great is the\\nvigilance with which she watches over her honour, that of all those that\\ncourt and woo her not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, that she\\nhas given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire. For\\nalthough she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the\\nshepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of them\\ncome to declare his intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy\\nas that of matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with\\nthis kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the\\nplague had got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the\\nhearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but\\nher scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so\\nthey know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and\\nhard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe the\\nnature of her character; and if you should remain here any time, senor,\\nyou would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\\nrejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\\nthere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of them\\nbut has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and\\nabove some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say\\nmore plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty.\\nHere one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love\\nsongs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of\\nthe night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without\\nhaving closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused\\nand bereft of sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs,\\nstretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer\\nnoontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and\\nthe other, over these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and\\ncareless. And all of us that know her are waiting to see what her pride\\nwill come to, and who is to be the happy man that will succeed in taming\\na nature so formidable and gaining possession of a beauty so supreme. All\\nthat I have told you being such well-established truth, I am persuaded\\nthat what they say of the cause of Chrysostom\\'s death, as our lad told\\nus, is the same. And so I advise you, senor, fail not to be present\\nto-morrow at his burial, which will be well worth seeing, for Chrysostom\\nhad many friends, and it is not half a league from this place to where he\\ndirected he should be buried.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will make a point of it,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I thank you for the\\npleasure you have given me by relating so interesting a tale.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh,\" said the goatherd, \"I do not know even the half of what has\\nhappened to the lovers of Marcela, but perhaps to-morrow we may fall in\\nwith some shepherd on the road who can tell us; and now it will be well\\nfor you to go and sleep under cover, for the night air may hurt your\\nwound, though with the remedy I have applied to you there is no fear of\\nan untoward result.\"',\n",
       " \"Sancho Panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on\\nhis part begged his master to go into Pedro's hut to sleep. He did so,\\nand passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady Dulcinea, in\\nimitation of the lovers of Marcela. Sancho Panza settled himself between\\nRocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been\\ndiscarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.\",\n",

Don Quixote, who desired nothing\\nbetter, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he\\ndid with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They\\nhad not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they\\nsaw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins\\nand with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter\\noleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along\\nwith them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome\\ntravelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them.\\nCourteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the\\nother which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound\\nfor the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.',\n",

In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.',\n",
       " 'This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was\\ncalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go\\narmed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote\\nreplied, \"The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in\\nany other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for\\nsoft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for\\nthose alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though\\nunworthy, am the least of all.\"',\n",
       " 'The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to\\nsettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo\\nproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.',\n",
       " '\"Have not your worships,\" replied Don Quixote, \"read the annals and\\nhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King\\nArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus, with\\nregard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received all over\\nthat kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but was\\nchanged by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he is to\\nreturn to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which reason it\\ncannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman ever killed a\\nraven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that famous order of\\nchivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was instituted, and the amour\\nof Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen Guinevere occurred, precisely\\nas is there related, the go-between and confidante therein being the\\nhighly honourable dame Quintanona, whence came that ballad so well known\\nand widely spread in our Spain--',\n",
       " 'O never surely was there knight\\n  So served by hand of dame,\\nAs served was he Sir Lancelot hight\\n  When he from Britain came--',\n",
       " 'with all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love and\\nwar. Handed down from that time, then, this order of chivalry went on\\nextending and spreading itself over many and various parts of the world;\\nand in it, famous and renowned for their deeds, were the mighty Amadis of\\nGaul with all his sons and descendants to the fifth generation, and the\\nvaliant Felixmarte of Hircania, and the never sufficiently praised\\nTirante el Blanco, and in our own days almost we have seen and heard and\\ntalked with the invincible knight Don Belianis of Greece. This, then,\\nsirs, is to be a knight-errant, and what I have spoken of is the order of\\nhis chivalry, of which, as I have already said, I, though a sinner, have\\nmade profession, and what the aforesaid knights professed that same do I\\nprofess, and so I go through these solitudes and wilds seeking\\nadventures, resolved in soul to oppose my arm and person to the most\\nperilous that fortune may offer me in aid of the weak and needy.\"',\n",
       " 'By these words of his the travellers were able to satisfy themselves of\\nDon Quixote\\'s being out of his senses and of the form of madness that\\novermastered him, at which they felt the same astonishment that all felt\\non first becoming acquainted with it; and Vivaldo, who was a person of\\ngreat shrewdness and of a lively temperament, in order to beguile the\\nshort journey which they said was required to reach the mountain, the\\nscene of the burial, sought to give him an opportunity of going on with\\nhis absurdities. So he said to him, \"It seems to me, Senor Knight-errant,\\nthat your worship has made choice of one of the most austere professions\\nin the world, and I imagine even that of the Carthusian monks is not so\\naustere.\"',\n",
       " '\"As austere it may perhaps be,\" replied our Don Quixote, \"but so\\nnecessary for the world I am very much inclined to doubt. For, if the\\ntruth is to be told, the soldier who executes what his captain orders\\ndoes no less than the captain himself who gives the order. My meaning,\\nis, that churchmen in peace and quiet pray to Heaven for the welfare of\\nthe world, but we soldiers and knights carry into effect what they pray\\nfor, defending it with the might of our arms and the edge of our swords,\\nnot under shelter but in the open air, a target for the intolerable rays\\nof the sun in summer and the piercing frosts of winter. Thus are we God\\'s\\nministers on earth and the arms by which his justice is done therein. And\\nas the business of war and all that relates and belongs to it cannot be\\nconducted without exceeding great sweat, toil, and exertion, it follows\\nthat those who make it their profession have undoubtedly more labour than\\nthose who in tranquil peace and quiet are engaged in praying to God to\\nhelp the weak. I do not mean to say, nor does it enter into my thoughts,\\nthat the knight-errant\\'s calling is as good as that of the monk in his\\ncell; I would merely infer from what I endure myself that it is beyond a\\ndoubt a more laborious and a more belaboured one, a hungrier and\\nthirstier, a wretcheder, raggeder, and lousier; for there is no reason to\\ndoubt that the knights-errant of yore endured much hardship in the course\\nof their lives. And if some of them by the might of their arms did rise\\nto be emperors, in faith it cost them dear in the matter of blood and\\nsweat; and if those who attained to that rank had not had magicians and\\nsages to help them they would have been completely baulked in their\\nambition and disappointed in their hopes.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is my own opinion,\" replied the traveller; \"but one thing among\\nmany others seems to me very wrong in knights-errant, and that is that\\nwhen they find themselves about to engage in some mighty and perilous\\nadventure in which there is manifest danger of losing their lives, they\\nnever at the moment of engaging in it think of commending themselves to\\nGod, as is the duty of every good Christian in like peril; instead of\\nwhich they commend themselves to their ladies with as much devotion as if\\nthese were their gods, a thing which seems to me to savour somewhat of\\nheathenism.\"',\n",
       " '\"Sir,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that cannot be on any account omitted, and\\nthe knight-errant would be disgraced who acted otherwise: for it is usual\\nand customary in knight-errantry that the knight-errant, who on engaging\\nin any great feat of arms has his lady before him, should turn his eyes\\ntowards her softly and lovingly, as though with them entreating her to\\nfavour and protect him in the hazardous venture he is about to undertake,\\nand even though no one hear him, he is bound to say certain words between\\nhis teeth, commending himself to her with all his heart, and of this we\\nhave innumerable instances in the histories. Nor is it to be supposed\\nfrom this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there\\nwill be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their\\ntask.\"',\n",
       " '\"For all that,\" answered the traveller, \"I feel some doubt still, because\\noften I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and\\nfrom one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and\\nthey wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then\\nwithout any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge,\\nand in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies;\\nand what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the\\nhaunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist\\'s\\nlance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his\\nhorse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead\\nman had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work\\nas this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in\\ncommending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been\\ndevoted to his duty and obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my\\nbelief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to,\\nfor they are not all in love.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is impossible,\" said Don Quixote: \"I say it is impossible that\\nthere could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as\\nnatural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most\\ncertainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a\\nknight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without\\none he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had\\ngained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the\\ndoor, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.\"',\n",
       " '\"Nevertheless,\" said the traveller, \"if I remember rightly, I think I\\nhave read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul,\\nnever had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he\\nwas not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.\"',\n",
       " 'To which our Don Quixote made answer, \"Sir, one solitary swallow does not\\nmake summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply in\\nlove; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his\\nfancy was a natural propensity which he could not control. But, in short,\\nit is very manifest that he had one alone whom he made mistress of his\\nwill, to whom he commended himself very frequently and very secretly, for\\nhe prided himself on being a reticent knight.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then if it be essential that every knight-errant should be in love,\"\\nsaid the traveller, \"it may be fairly supposed that your worship is so,\\nas you are of the order; and if you do not pride yourself on being as\\nreticent as Don Galaor, I entreat you as earnestly as I can, in the name\\nof all this company and in my own, to inform us of the name, country,\\nrank, and beauty of your lady, for she will esteem herself fortunate if\\nall the world knows that she is loved and served by such a knight as your\\nworship seems to be.\"',\n",
       " 'At this Don Quixote heaved a deep sigh and said, \"I cannot say positively\\nwhether my sweet enemy is pleased or not that the world should know I\\nserve her; I can only say in answer to what has been so courteously asked\\nof me, that her name is Dulcinea, her country El Toboso, a village of La\\nMancha, her rank must be at least that of a princess, since she is my\\nqueen and lady, and her beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and\\nfanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are\\nverified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields, her\\neyebrows rainbows, her eyes suns, her cheeks roses, her lips coral, her\\nteeth pearls, her neck alabaster, her bosom marble, her hands ivory, her\\nfairness snow, and what modesty conceals from sight such, I think and\\nimagine, as rational reflection can only extol, not compare.\"',\n",
       " '\"We should like to know her lineage, race, and ancestry,\" said Vivaldo.',\n",
       " 'To which Don Quixote replied, \"She is not of the ancient Roman Curtii,\\nCaii, or Scipios, nor of the modern Colonnas or Orsini, nor of the\\nMoncadas or Requesenes of Catalonia, nor yet of the Rebellas or\\nVillanovas of Valencia; Palafoxes, Nuzas, Rocabertis, Corellas, Lunas,\\nAlagones, Urreas, Foces, or Gurreas of Aragon; Cerdas, Manriques,\\nMendozas, or Guzmans of Castile; Alencastros, Pallas, or Meneses of\\nPortugal; but she is of those of El Toboso of La Mancha, a lineage that\\nthough modern, may furnish a source of gentle blood for the most\\nillustrious families of the ages that are to come, and this let none\\ndispute with me save on the condition that Zerbino placed at the foot of\\nthe trophy of Orlando\\'s arms, saying,',\n",

       " '\"Although mine is of the Cachopins of Laredo,\" said the traveller, \"I\\nwill not venture to compare it with that of El Toboso of La Mancha,\\nthough, to tell the truth, no such surname has until now ever reached my\\nears.\"',\n",
       " '\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"has that never reached them?\"',\n",
       " 'The rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the\\nconversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds\\nperceived how exceedingly out of his wits our Don Quixote was. Sancho\\nPanza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing who\\nhe was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any\\ndifficulty in believing was that about the fair Dulcinea del Toboso,\\nbecause neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his\\nknowledge though he lived so close to El Toboso. They were going along\\nconversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high\\nmountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool,\\nand crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of\\nthem of yew, some of cypress. Six of the number were carrying a bier\\ncovered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing which one\\nof the goatherds said, \"Those who come there are the bearers of\\nChrysostom\\'s body, and the foot of that mountain is the place where he\\nordered them to bury him.\" They therefore made haste to reach the spot,\\nand did so by the time those who came had laid the bier upon the ground,\\nand four of them with sharp pickaxes were digging a grave by the side of\\na hard rock. They greeted each other courteously, and then Don Quixote\\nand those who accompanied him turned to examine the bier, and on it,\\ncovered with flowers, they saw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to\\nall appearance of one thirty years of age, and showing even in death that\\nin life he had been of comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on\\nthe bier itself were laid some books, and several papers open and folded;\\nand those who were looking on as well as those who were opening the grave\\nand all the others who were there preserved a strange silence, until one\\nof those who had borne the body said to another, \"Observe carefully,\\nAmbrosia if this is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious\\nthat what he directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.\"',\n",
       " '\"This is the place,\" answered Ambrosia \"for in it many a time did my poor\\nfriend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told me,\\nthat he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race, and\\nhere, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as\\nhonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela ended\\nby scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his wretched\\nlife to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he desired to\\nbe laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.\" Then turning to Don Quixote\\nand the travellers he went on to say, \"That body, sirs, on which you are\\nlooking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul on which Heaven\\nbestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body of Chrysostom, who\\nwas unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy, unapproached in gentle\\nbearing, a phoenix in friendship, generous without limit, grave without\\narrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in short, first in all that\\nconstitutes goodness and second to none in all that makes up misfortune.\\nHe loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he was scorned; he wooed a wild\\nbeast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued the wind, he cried to the\\nwilderness, he served ingratitude, and for reward was made the prey of\\ndeath in the mid-course of life, cut short by a shepherdess whom he\\nsought to immortalise in the memory of man, as these papers which you see\\ncould fully prove, had he not commanded me to consign them to the fire\\nafter having consigned his body to the earth.\"',\n",
       " '\"You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner\\nhimself,\" said Vivaldo, \"for it is neither right nor proper to do the\\nwill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have\\nbeen reasonable in Augustus Caesar had he permitted the directions left\\nby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,\\nSenor Ambrosia while you consign your friend\\'s body to the earth, you\\nshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order in\\nbitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey\\nit. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of\\nMarcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men\\nto shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have\\ncome here know already the story of this your love-stricken and\\nheart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of\\nhis death, and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from\\nwhich sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the\\nlove of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the\\nend awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens\\nto their eyes. Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he\\nwas to be buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct\\nroad and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of\\nhad so moved our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and\\nour desire to prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you,\\nexcellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my own account entreat you, that\\ninstead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them.\"',\n",

       " '\"That is true,\" said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper\\nof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous\\nvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their\\neyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave\\nthere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty\\nexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed\\nupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see her\\nwere not less amazed than those who had never seen her before.

       " '\"Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if\\nin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being\\nthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work of\\nthy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to look\\ndown from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in thy\\narrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful daughter\\ntrampled on her father Tarquin\\'s? Tell us quickly for what thou art come,\\nor what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the thoughts of\\nChrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make all these who\\ncall themselves his friends obey thee, though he be dead.\"',\n",
       " '\"I come not, Ambrosia for any of the purposes thou hast named,\" replied\\nMarcela, \"but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all\\nthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom\\'s death; and\\ntherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for\\nwill not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to persons\\nof sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that\\nin spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love\\nyou show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that\\nnatural understanding which God has given me I know that everything\\nbeautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved,\\nthat which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it;\\nbesides, it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be\\nugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, \"I love\\nthee because thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.\" But\\nsupposing the beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the\\ninclinations must be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that\\nexcites love, some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection;\\nand if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart, the will\\nwould wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as\\nthere is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of\\ninclinations, and true love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and\\nmust be voluntary and not compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to\\nbe, why do you desire me to bend my will by force, for no other reason\\nbut that you say you love me? Nay--tell me--had Heaven made me ugly, as it\\nhas made me beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not\\nloving me? Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no\\nchoice of mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me\\nwithout my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with\\nit, does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a\\ngift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for\\nbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the\\none does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come too\\nnear. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without which the\\nbody, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful; but if modesty\\nis one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and charm to mind and\\nbody, why should she who is loved for her beauty part with it to gratify\\none who for his pleasure alone strives with all his might and energy to\\nrob her of it? I was born free, and that I might live in freedom I chose\\nthe solitude of the fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society,\\nthe clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and\\nwaters I make known my thoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword\\nlaid aside. Those whom I have inspired with love by letting them see me,\\nI have by words undeceived, and if their longings live on hope--and I\\nhave given none to Chrysostom or to any other--it cannot justly be said\\nthat the death of any is my doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy\\nthan my cruelty that killed him; and if it be made a charge against me\\nthat his wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield\\nto them, I answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made\\nhe declared to me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live\\nin perpetual solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits\\nof my retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open\\navowal, he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what\\nwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I\\nhad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should\\nhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was\\npersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated. Bethink\\nyou now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid to my\\ncharge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way to\\ndespair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter himself\\nwhom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but let not him\\ncall me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon whom I practise\\nno deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has not been so far\\nthe will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to expect me to love\\nby choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve for each of my\\nsuitors on his own account, and let it be understood from this time forth\\nthat if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy or misery he dies, for\\nshe who loves no one can give no cause for jealousy to any, and candour\\nis not to be confounded with scorn. Let him who calls me wild beast and\\nbasilisk, leave me alone as something noxious and evil; let him who calls\\nme ungrateful, withhold his service; who calls me wayward, seek not my\\nacquaintance; who calls me cruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast,\\nthis basilisk, this ungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of\\ndesire to seek, serve, know, or follow them. If Chrysostom\\'s impatience\\nand violent passion killed him, why should my modest behaviour and\\ncircumspection be blamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the\\ntrees, why should he who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob\\nme of it? I have, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of\\nothers; my taste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I\\nneither love nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or\\ntrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the shepherd\\ngirls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my recreations; my\\ndesires are bounded by these mountains, and if they ever wander hence it\\nis to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps by which the soul\\ntravels to its primeval abode.\"',\n",

       " '\"I count for a hundred,\" replied Don Quixote, and without more words he\\ndrew his sword and attacked the Yanguesans and excited and impelled by\\nthe example of his master, Sancho did the same; and to begin with, Don\\nQuixote delivered a slash at one of them that laid open the leather\\njerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. The\\nYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were\\nso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the\\nmiddle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the\\nsecond blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote fared the\\nsame way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate\\nwilled it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who had not yet\\nrisen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry\\nboorish hands.',\n",

       " '\"For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\" said the battered knight\\nDon Quixote; \"but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business\\nto put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like\\nmyself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the\\nlaws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be\\nadministered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou\\nshouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to\\nthee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us. It is at\\nwhen thou shalt see rabble of this sort offering us insult thou art not\\nto wait till I draw sword against them, for I shall not do so at all; but\\ndo thou draw sword and chastise them to thy heart\\'s content, and if any\\nknights come to their aid and defence I will take care to defend thee and\\nassail them with all my might; and thou hast already seen by a thousand\\nsigns and proofs what the might of this strong arm of mine is equal\\nto\"--so uplifted had the poor gentleman become through the victory over\\nthe stout Biscayan.',\n",

       " 'To all which his master said in reply, \"I wish I had breath enough to\\nspeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would abate\\nso as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.

Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible through not being\\na knight nor having any desire to be one, nor possessing the courage nor\\nthe will to avenge insults or defend thy lordship; for thou must know\\nthat in newly conquered kingdoms and provinces the minds of the\\ninhabitants are never so quiet nor so well disposed to the new lord that\\nthere is no fear of their making some move to change matters once more,\\nand try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential\\nthat the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern,\\nand valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him.\"',\n",

See if your worship can get up, and let us help Rocinante,\\nthough he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this\\nthrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to be a\\nvirtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right that it\\ntakes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure\\nin this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your\\nworship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling\\npost and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks as has\\nfallen upon our shoulders?\"',\n",
       " '\"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought to be used to such\\nsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain they\\nmust feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not that I\\nimagine--why do I say imagine?--know of a certainty that all these\\nannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I\\nwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\"',\n",

       " '\"Know, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of\\nknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and neither\\nmore nor less is it within immediate possibility for knights-errant to\\nbecome kings and emperors, as experience has shown in the case of many\\ndifferent knights with whose histories I am thoroughly acquainted; and I\\ncould tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of some who simply by\\nmight of arm have risen to the high stations I have mentioned; and those\\nsame, both before and after, experienced divers misfortunes and miseries;\\nfor the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself in the power of his mortal\\nenemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is positively asserted, holding him\\ncaptive, gave him more than two hundred lashes with the reins of his\\nhorse while tied to one of the pillars of a court; and moreover there is\\na certain recondite author of no small authority who says that the Knight\\nof Phoebus, being caught in a certain pitfall, which opened under his\\nfeet in a certain castle, on falling found himself bound hand and foot in\\na deep pit underground, where they administered to him one of those\\nthings they call clysters, of sand and snow-water, that well-nigh\\nfinished him; and if he had not been succoured in that sore extremity by\\na sage, a great friend of his, it would have gone very hard with the poor\\nknight; so I may well suffer in company with such worthy folk, for\\ngreater were the indignities which they had to suffer than those which we\\nsuffer. For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any\\ninstruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity,\\nand this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if, for\\ninstance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his\\nhand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that\\nreason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest\\nthou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we\\nhave therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried,\\nwith which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not\\none of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\"',\n",
       " '\"They gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly had\\nI laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with\\ntheir sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and\\nthe strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where\\nthinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not\\ngives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will\\nremain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\"',\n",
       " '\"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\\nthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain\\nwhich death does not remove.\"',\n",
       " '\"And what greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the one\\nthat waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If our\\nmishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it\\nwould not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the plasters in\\na hospital almost won\\'t be enough to put us right.\"',\n",
       " '\"No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to\\ndo,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and let us see how Rocinante is, for it seems\\nto me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of\\nthe poor beast.\"',\n",
       " '\"There is nothing wonderful in that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a\\nknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come off\\nscot-free where we come out scotched.\"',\n",
       " '\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief\\nto it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so because this little beast may now\\nsupply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle where I\\nmay be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any dishonour\\nto be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old Silenus,\\nthe tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he entered the\\ncity of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on a handsome\\nass.\"',\n",
       " '\"It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered\\nSancho, \"but there is a great difference between going mounted and going\\nslung like a sack of manure.\"',\n",

       " '\"And yet I have heard your worship say,\" observed Panza, \"that it is very\\nmeet for knights-errant to sleep in wastes and deserts, and that they\\nesteem it very good fortune.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is,\" said Don Quixote, \"when they cannot help it, or when they are\\nin love; and so true is this that there have been knights who have\\nremained two years on rocks, in sunshine and shade and all the\\ninclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and\\none of these was Amadis, when, under the name of Beltenebros, he took up\\nhis abode on the Pena Pobre for--I know not if it was eight years or\\neight months, for I am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he\\nstayed there doing penance for I know not what pique the Princess Oriana\\nhad against him; but no more of this now, Sancho, and make haste before a\\nmishap like Rocinante\\'s befalls the ass.\"',\n",
       " '\"The very devil would be in it in that case,\" said Sancho; and letting\\noff thirty \"ohs,\" and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions\\nand execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he\\nraised himself, stopping half-way bent like a Turkish bow without power\\nto bring himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who\\ntoo had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the\\nday; he next raised up Rocinante, and as for him, had he possessed a\\ntongue to complain with, most assuredly neither Sancho nor his master\\nwould have been behind him.',\n",
       " 'To be brief, Sancho fixed Don Quixote on the ass and secured Rocinante\\nwith a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more\\nor less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might\\nbe; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to\\nbetter, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and\\non it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of\\nDon Quixote must needs be a castle. Sancho insisted that it was an inn,\\nand his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the dispute lasted\\nso long that before the point was settled they had time to reach it, and\\ninto it Sancho entered with all his team without any further controversy.',\n",

       " \"\\nThe innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho what\\nwas amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that he had\\nfallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The innkeeper\\nhad a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her calling\\ncommonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for the\\nsufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don\\nQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in\\ntaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an\\nAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one\\neye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be\\nsure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from\\nhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made\\nher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass, then,\\nhelped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don Quixote\\nin a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served for many\\nyears as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a carrier whose\\nbed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and, though only made\\nof the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much the advantage of\\nit, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough boards on two not\\nvery even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness might have passed for a\\nquilt, full of pellets which, were they not seen through the rents to be\\nwool, would to the touch have seemed pebbles in hardness, two sheets made\\nof buckler leather, and a coverlet the threads of which anyone that chose\\nmight have counted without missing one in the reckoning.\",\n",
       " 'On this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and\\nher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while\\nMaritornes--for that was the name of the Asturian--held the light for\\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of wheals\\nDon Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the look of\\nblows than of a fall.',\n",
       " 'It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and\\nprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. \"Pray, senora,\" he\\nadded, \"manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of some one to\\nuse it, for my loins too are rather sore.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess.',\n",
       " '\"I did not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at seeing\\nmy master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand\\nthwacks.\"',\n",
       " '\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time happened\\nto me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to\\nthe ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and\\nshaken as if I had really fallen.\"',\n",
       " '\"There is the point, senora,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"that I without\\ndreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with\\nscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\"',\n",
       " '\"How is the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian.',\n",
       " '\"Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a\\nknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen\\nin the world this long time past.\"',\n",
       " '\"What is a knight-adventurer?\" said the lass.',\n",
       " '\"Are you so new in the world as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza.\\n\"Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing\\nthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most\\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or\\nthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master\\nas this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a\\ncounty?\"',\n",
       " '\"It is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month\\ngoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that\\ncan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for\\nanother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of\\nthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not\\nchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.\"',\n",
       " 'To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and\\nsitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand\\nhe said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate\\nin having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that\\nif I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said,\\nthat self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am. I only\\ntell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on my memory the\\nservice you have rendered me in order to tender you my gratitude while\\nlife shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me not so enthralled\\nand subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair ingrate whom I name\\nbetween my teeth, but that those of this lovely damsel might be the\\nmasters of my liberty.\"',\n",
       " 'The hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in\\nbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood about\\nas much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they could\\nperceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and\\nblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they\\nstared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man of\\na different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in\\npothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave\\nher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.',\n",
       " 'The carrier had made an arrangement with her for recreation that night,\\nand she had given him her word that when the guests were quiet and the\\nfamily asleep she would come in search of him and meet his wishes\\nunreservedly. And it is said of this good lass that she never made\\npromises of the kind without fulfilling them, even though she made them\\nin a forest and without any witness present, for she plumed herself\\ngreatly on being a lady and held it no disgrace to be in such an\\nemployment as servant in an inn, because, she said, misfortunes and\\nill-luck had brought her to that position. The hard, narrow, wretched,\\nrickety bed of Don Quixote stood first in the middle of this star-lit\\nstable, and close beside it Sancho made his, which merely consisted of a\\nrush mat and a blanket that looked as if it was of threadbare canvas\\nrather than of wool. Next to these two beds was that of the carrier, made\\nup, as has been said, of the pack-saddles and all the trappings of the\\ntwo best mules he had, though there were twelve of them, sleek, plump,\\nand in prime condition, for he was one of the rich carriers of Arevalo,\\naccording to the author of this history, who particularly mentions this\\ncarrier because he knew him very well, and they even say was in some\\ndegree a relation of his; besides which Cide Hamete Benengeli was a\\nhistorian of great research and accuracy in all things, as is very\\nevident since he would not pass over in silence those that have been\\nalready mentioned, however trifling and insignificant they might be, an\\nexample that might be followed by those grave historians who relate\\ntransactions so curtly and briefly that we hardly get a taste of them,\\nall the substance of the work being left in the inkstand from\\ncarelessness, perverseness, or ignorance. A thousand blessings on the\\nauthor of \"Tablante de Ricamonte\" and that of the other book in which the\\ndeeds of the Conde Tomillas are recounted; with what minuteness they\\ndescribe everything!',\n",
       " \"To proceed, then: after having paid a visit to his team and given them\\ntheir second feed, the carrier stretched himself on his pack-saddles and\\nlay waiting for his conscientious Maritornes.

       " \"The inn was all in silence, and in the whole of it there was no light\\nexcept that given by a lantern that hung burning in the middle of the\\ngateway. This strange stillness, and the thoughts, always present to our\\nknight's mind, of the incidents described at every turn in the books that\\nwere the cause of his misfortune, conjured up to his imagination as\\nextraordinary a delusion as can well be conceived, which was that he\\nfancied himself to have reached a famous castle (for, as has been said,\\nall the inns he lodged in were castles to his eyes), and that the\\ndaughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and\\nthat she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and\\nhad promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the\\nknowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had\\nconstructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the\\nperilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in\\nhis heart to commit no treason to his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, even\\nthough the queen Guinevere herself and the dame Quintanona should present\\nthemselves before him.\",\n",

The Asturian, who went all doubled up and in\\nsilence with her hands before her feeling for her lover, encountered the\\narms of Don Quixote, who grasped her tightly by the wrist, and drawing\\nher towards him, while she dared not utter a word, made her sit down on\\nthe bed. He then felt her smock, and although it was of sackcloth it\\nappeared to him to be of the finest and softest silk: on her wrists she\\nwore some glass beads, but to him they had the sheen of precious Orient\\npearls: her hair, which in some measure resembled a horse's mane, he\\nrated as threads of the brightest gold of Araby, whose refulgence dimmed\\nthe sun himself: her breath, which no doubt smelt of yesterday's stale\\nsalad, seemed to him to diffuse a sweet aromatic fragrance from her\\nmouth; and, in short, he drew her portrait in his imagination with the\\nsame features and in the same style as that which he had seen in his\\nbooks of the other princesses who, smitten by love, came with all the\\nadornments that are here set down, to see the sorely wounded knight; and\\nso great was the poor gentleman's blindness that neither touch, nor\\nsmell, nor anything else about the good lass that would have made any but\\na carrier vomit, were enough to undeceive him; on the contrary, he was\\npersuaded he had the goddess of beauty in his arms, and holding her\\nfirmly in his grasp he went on to say in low, tender voice:\",\n",
       " '\"Would that found myself, lovely and exalted lady, in a position to repay\\nsuch a favour as that which you, by the sight of your great beauty, have\\ngranted me; but fortune, which is never weary of persecuting the good,\\nhas chosen to place me upon this bed, where I lie so bruised and broken\\nthat though my inclination would gladly comply with yours it is\\nimpossible; besides, to this impossibility another yet greater is to be\\nadded, which is the faith that I have pledged to the peerless Dulcinea\\ndel Toboso, sole lady of my most secret thoughts; and were it not that\\nthis stood in the way I should not be so insensible a knight as to miss\\nthe happy opportunity which your great goodness has offered me.\"',\n",

With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp\\nhastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench,\\nseeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was\\nterrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza,\\nwho still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself.\",\n",
       " 'The innkeeper came in exclaiming, \"Where art thou, strumpet?

He then,\\nfinding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as\\nwell as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them\\nbegan the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world. The carrier,\\nhowever, perceiving by the light of the innkeeper candle how it fared\\nwith his ladylove, quitting Don Quixote, ran to bring her the help she\\nneeded; and the innkeeper did the same but with a different intention,\\nfor his was to chastise the lass, as he believed that beyond a doubt she\\nalone was the cause of all the harmony. And so, as the saying is, cat to\\nrat, rat to rope, rope to stick, the carrier pounded Sancho, Sancho the\\nlass, she him, and the innkeeper her, and all worked away so briskly that\\nthey did not give themselves a moment\\'s rest; and the best of it was that\\nthe innkeeper\\'s lamp went out, and as they were left in the dark they all\\nlaid on one upon the other in a mass so unmercifully that there was not a\\nsound spot left where a hand could light.',\n",
       " 'It so happened that there was lodging that night in the inn a caudrillero\\nof what they call the Old Holy Brotherhood of Toledo, who, also hearing\\nthe extraordinary noise of the conflict, seized his staff and the tin\\ncase with his warrants, and made his way in the dark into the room\\ncrying: \"Hold! in the name of the Jurisdiction!

The innkeeper\\nretreated to his room, the carrier to his pack-saddles, the lass to her\\ncrib; the unlucky Don Quixote and Sancho alone were unable to move from\\nwhere they were.

       " '\"It is not for that,\" replied Sancho, \"but because I hate keeping things\\nlong, and I don\\'t want them to grow rotten with me from over-keeping.\"',\n",
       " '\"At any rate,\" said Don Quixote, \"I have more confidence in thy affection\\nand good nature; and so I would have thee know that this night there\\nbefell me one of the strangest adventures that I could describe, and to\\nrelate it to thee briefly thou must know that a little while ago the\\ndaughter of the lord of this castle came to me, and that she is the most\\nelegant and beautiful damsel that could be found in the wide world. What\\nI could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her lively wit! of\\nother secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe to my lady\\nDulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in silence! I will\\nonly tell thee that, either fate being envious of so great a boon placed\\nin my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this is more probable) this\\ncastle being, as I have already said, enchanted, at the time when I was\\nengaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came,\\nwithout my seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm\\nof some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that I have them\\nall bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that I am in a\\nworse plight than yesterday when the carriers, on account of Rocinante\\'s\\nmisbehaviour, inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence\\nconjecture that there must be some enchanted Moor guarding the treasure\\nof this damsel\\'s beauty, and that it is not for me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than four hundred Moors have\\nso thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread\\nto it. But tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare\\nadventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your worship was\\nnot so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable beauty you spoke\\nof; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks I think I had in\\nall my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me! for I am not a\\nknight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the mishaps, the\\ngreater part falls to my share.\"',\n",

       " 'By this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and came\\nin to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho caught\\nsight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a cloth on\\nhis head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding countenance, he\\nsaid to his master, \"Senor, can it be that this is the enchanted Moor\\ncoming back to give us more castigation if there be anything still left\\nin the ink-bottle?\"',\n",

       " 'The cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\\nsorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of\\noil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him a\\nbadly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and Sancho\\nPanza said, \"That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Senor, and he keeps\\nthe treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and lamp-whacks.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is the truth,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in\\ntroubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\\nvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\\none on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\\ncanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\\nlittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam, for\\nindeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing much\\nblood from the wound that phantom gave me.\"',\n",
       " 'Sancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the innkeeper\\nin the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see what had\\nbecome of his enemy, he said to him, \"Senor, whoever you are, do us the\\nfavour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt, and wine,\\nfor it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on earth, who\\nlies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted Moor that is in\\nthis inn.\"',\n",
       " 'When the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out of\\nhis senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\\ngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\\nhost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\\nQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\\nblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\\nof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat that\\nflowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be brief, he\\ntook the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them all and\\nboiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to\\nperfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as there was\\nnot one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin oil-bottle or\\nflask of which the host made him a free gift; and over the flask he\\nrepeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more ave-marias,\\nsalves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by way of\\nbenediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the innkeeper, and\\nthe cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully engaged in attending\\nto the comfort of his mules.',\n",
       " 'This being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\\nspot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and so\\nhe drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had he\\ndone drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was left\\nin his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke into a\\nprofuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and leave\\nhim alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three hours, at the\\nend of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief and so much ease\\nfrom his bruises that he thought himself quite cured, and verily believed\\nhe had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that with this remedy he\\nmight thenceforward, without any fear, face any kind of destruction,\\nbattle, or combat, however perilous it might be.',\n",
       " 'Sancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\\nmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\\nwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with both\\nhands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and drained off\\nvery little less than his master. But the fact is, that the stomach of\\npoor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his master, and\\nso, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and retchings, and\\nsuch sweats and faintness, that verily and truly be believed his last\\nhour had come, and finding himself so racked and tormented he cursed the\\nbalsam and the thief that had given it to him.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho, that\\nthis mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am persuaded\\nthis liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\"',\n",
       " '\"If your worship knew that,\" returned Sancho--\"woe betide me and all my\\nkindred!--why did you let me taste it?\"',\n",
       " \"At this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\\ndischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\\nthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\\nconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end had\\ncome. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the end of\\nwhich he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he\\ncould not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt\\nhimself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in\\nquest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered\\nthere was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his\\nhelp and protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence\\nhis balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled\\nRocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom\\nlikewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his\\nhorse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that\\nstood there, to serve him by way of a lance. All that were in the inn,\\nwho were more than twenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper's\\ndaughter was likewise observing him, and he too never took his eyes off\\nher, and from time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from\\nthe depths of his bowels; but they all thought it must be from the pain\\nhe felt in his ribs; at any rate they who had seen him plastered the\\nnight before thought so.\",\n",
       " 'As soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\\nthe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, \"Many and great are\\nthe favours, Senor Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of yours,\\nand I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you for them\\nall the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you of any\\narrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is no other\\nthan to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to chastise\\nperfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you\\nneed only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood\\nwhich I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the\\nutmost of your desire.\"',\n",
       " 'The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not\\nwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me\\nI can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is that\\nyou pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well\\nfor the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"And a very respectable one,\" said the innkeeper.',\n",
       " '\"I have been under a mistake all this time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for\\nin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it\\nappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\\nthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\\nknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have\\nread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or\\nanything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that\\nmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the\\ninsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day,\\nin summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst,\\ncold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the\\nhardships of earth.\"',\n",
       " '\"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me what you\\nowe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about is\\nto get my money.\"',\n",
       " '\"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don Quixote, and putting spurs\\nto Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn\\nbefore anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking\\nto see if his squire was following him.',\n",
       " 'The innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of\\nSancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,\\nbecause, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and\\nreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying\\nanything in inns and hostelries. At this the innkeeper waxed very wroth,\\nand threatened if he did not pay to compel him in a way that he would not\\nlike. To which Sancho made answer that by the law of chivalry his master\\nhad received he would not pay a rap, though it cost him his life; for the\\nexcellent and ancient usage of knights-errant was not going to be\\nviolated by him, nor should the squires of such as were yet to come into\\nthe world ever complain of him or reproach him with breaking so just a\\nprivilege.',\n",
       " \"The ill-luck of the unfortunate Sancho so ordered it that among the\\ncompany in the inn there were four woolcarders from Segovia, three\\nneedle-makers from the Colt of Cordova, and two lodgers from the Fair of\\nSeville, lively fellows, tender-hearted, fond of a joke, and playful,\\nwho, almost as if instigated and moved by a common impulse, made up to\\nSancho and dismounted him from his ass, while one of them went in for the\\nblanket of the host's bed; but on flinging him into it they looked up,\\nand seeing that the ceiling was somewhat lower what they required for\\ntheir work, they decided upon going out into the yard, which was bounded\\nby the sky, and there, putting Sancho in the middle of the blanket, they\\nbegan to raise him high, making sport with him as they would with a dog\\nat Shrovetide.\",\n",
       " 'The cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the\\nears of his master, who, halting to listen attentively, was persuaded\\nthat some new adventure was coming, until he clearly perceived that it\\nwas his squire who uttered them. Wheeling about he came up to the inn\\nwith a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went round it to see if he\\ncould find some way of getting in; but as soon as he came to the wall of\\nthe yard, which was not very high, he discovered the game that was being\\nplayed with his squire. He saw him rising and falling in the air with\\nsuch grace and nimbleness that, had his rage allowed him, it is my belief\\nhe would have laughed. He tried to climb from his horse on to the top of\\nthe wall, but he was so bruised and battered that he could not even\\ndismount; and so from the back of his horse he began to utter such\\nmaledictions and objurgations against those who were blanketing Sancho as\\nit would be impossible to write down accurately: they, however, did not\\nstay their laughter or their work for this, nor did the flying Sancho\\ncease his lamentations, mingled now with threats, now with entreaties but\\nall to little purpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they\\nleft off. They then brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it\\nthey put his jacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing\\nhim so exhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and\\nthat it might be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took\\nit, and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of\\nhis master exclaiming, \"Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not, my\\nson, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and he\\nheld up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou wilt\\ncertainly be restored.\"',\n",
       " 'At these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder\\nvoice said, \"Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a knight,\\nor do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left after\\nlast night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and leave me\\nto myself!\" and at one and the same instant he left off talking and began\\ndrinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was water he did not\\ncare to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch him some wine,\\nwhich she did with right good will, and paid for it with her own money;\\nfor indeed they say of her that, though she was in that line of life,\\nthere was some faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her.\\nWhen Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels into his ass, and the gate\\nof the inn being thrown open he passed out very well pleased at having\\npaid nothing and carried his point, though it had been at the expense of\\nhis usual sureties, his shoulders. It is true that the innkeeper detained\\nhis alforjas in payment of what was owing to him, but Sancho took his\\ndeparture in such a flurry that he never missed them. The innkeeper, as\\nsoon as he saw him off, wanted to bar the gate close, but the blanketers\\nwould not agree to it, for they were fellows who would not have cared two\\nfarthings for Don Quixote, even had he been really one of the\\nknights-errant of the Round Table.',\n",

       " 'IN WHICH IS RELATED THE DISCOURSE SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER, DON\\nQUIXOTE, AND OTHER ADVENTURES WORTH RELATING',\n",
       " 'Sancho reached his master so limp and faint that he could not urge on his\\nbeast. When Don Quixote saw the state he was in he said, \"I have now come\\nto the conclusion, good Sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt\\nenchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with\\nthee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and I\\nhold this confirmed by having noticed that when I was by the wall of the\\nyard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to\\nmount upon it, nor could I even dismount from Rocinante, because they no\\ndoubt had me enchanted; for I swear to thee by the faith of what I am\\nthat if I had been able to climb up or dismount, I would have avenged\\nthee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered\\ntheir freak for ever, even though in so doing I knew that I contravened\\nthe laws of chivalry, which, as I have often told thee, do not permit a\\nknight to lay hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and\\ngreat necessity in defence of his own life and person.\"',\n",
       " '\"I would have avenged myself too if I could,\" said Sancho, \"whether I had\\nbeen dubbed knight or not, but I could not; though for my part I am\\npersuaded those who amused themselves with me were not phantoms or\\nenchanted men, as your worship says, but men of flesh and bone like\\nourselves; and they all had their names, for I heard them name them when\\nthey were tossing me, and one was called Pedro Martinez, and another\\nTenorio Hernandez, and the innkeeper, I heard, was called Juan Palomeque\\nthe Left-handed; so that, senor, your not being able to leap over the\\nwall of the yard or dismount from your horse came of something else\\nbesides enchantments; and what I make out clearly from all this is, that\\nthese adventures we go seeking will in the end lead us into such\\nmisadventures that we shall not know which is our right foot; and that\\nthe best and wisest thing, according to my small wits, would be for us to\\nreturn home, now that it is harvest-time, and attend to our business, and\\ngive over wandering from Zeca to Mecca and from pail to bucket, as the\\nsaying is.\"',\n",
       " '\"How little thou knowest about chivalry, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote;\\n\"hold thy peace and have patience; the day will come when thou shalt see\\nwith thine own eyes what an honourable thing it is to wander in the\\npursuit of this calling; nay, tell me, what greater pleasure can there be\\nin the world, or what delight can equal that of winning a battle, and\\ntriumphing over one\\'s enemy? None, beyond all doubt.\"',\n",
       " '\"Very likely,\" answered Sancho, \"though I do not know it; all I know is\\nthat since we have been knights-errant, or since your worship has been\\none (for I have no right to reckon myself one of so honourable a number)\\nwe have never won any battle except the one with the Biscayan, and even\\nout of that your worship came with half an ear and half a helmet the\\nless; and from that till now it has been all cudgellings and more\\ncudgellings, cuffs and more cuffs, I getting the blanketing over and\\nabove, and falling in with enchanted persons on whom I cannot avenge\\nmyself so as to know what the delight, as your worship calls it, of\\nconquering an enemy is like.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is what vexes me, and what ought to vex thee, Sancho,\" replied Don\\nQuixote; \"but henceforward I will endeavour to have at hand some sword\\nmade by such craft that no kind of enchantments can take effect upon him\\nwho carries it, and it is even possible that fortune may procure for me\\nthat which belonged to Amadis when he was called \\'The Knight of the\\nBurning Sword,\\' which was one of the best swords that ever knight in the\\nworld possessed, for, besides having the said virtue, it cut like a\\nrazor, and there was no armour, however strong and enchanted it might be,\\nthat could resist it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Such is my luck,\" said Sancho, \"that even if that happened and your\\nworship found some such sword, it would, like the balsam, turn out\\nserviceable and good for dubbed knights only, and as for the squires,\\nthey might sup sorrow.\"',\n",
       " '\"Fear not that, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote: \"Heaven will deal better by\\nthee.\"',\n",
       " 'Thus talking, Don Quixote and his squire were going along, when, on the\\nroad they were following, Don Quixote perceived approaching them a large\\nand thick cloud of dust, on seeing which he turned to Sancho and said:',\n",
       " '\"This is the day, Sancho, on which will be seen the boon my fortune is\\nreserving for me; this, I say, is the day on which as much as on any\\nother shall be displayed the might of my arm, and on which I shall do\\ndeeds that shall remain written in the book of fame for all ages to come.\\nSeest thou that cloud of dust which rises yonder? Well, then, all that is\\nchurned up by a vast army composed of various and countless nations that\\ncomes marching there.\"',\n",
       " '\"According to that there must be two,\" said Sancho, \"for on this opposite\\nside also there rises just such another cloud of dust.\"',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote turned to look and found that it was true, and rejoicing\\nexceedingly, he concluded that they were two armies about to engage and\\nencounter in the midst of that broad plain; for at all times and seasons\\nhis fancy was full of the battles, enchantments, adventures, crazy feats,\\nloves, and defiances that are recorded in the books of chivalry, and\\neverything he said, thought, or did had reference to such things. Now the\\ncloud of dust he had seen was raised by two great droves of sheep coming\\nalong the same road in opposite directions, which, because of the dust,\\ndid not become visible until they drew near, but Don Quixote asserted so\\npositively that they were armies that Sancho was led to believe it and\\nsay, \"Well, and what are we to do, senor?\"',\n",
       " '\"What?\" said Don Quixote: \"give aid and assistance to the weak and those\\nwho need it; and thou must know, Sancho, that this which comes opposite\\nto us is conducted and led by the mighty emperor Alifanfaron, lord of the\\ngreat isle of Trapobana; this other that marches behind me is that of his\\nenemy the king of the Garamantas, Pentapolin of the Bare Arm, for he\\nalways goes into battle with his right arm bare.\"',\n",
       " '\"But why are these two lords such enemies?\"',\n",
       " '\"They are at enmity,\" replied Don Quixote, \"because this Alifanfaron is a\\nfurious pagan and is in love with the daughter of Pentapolin, who is a\\nvery beautiful and moreover gracious lady, and a Christian, and her\\nfather is unwilling to bestow her upon the pagan king unless he first\\nabandons the religion of his false prophet Mahomet, and adopts his own.\"',\n",
       " '\"By my beard,\" said Sancho, \"but Pentapolin does quite right, and I will\\nhelp him as much as I can.\"',\n",
       " '\"In that thou wilt do what is thy duty, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"for\\nto engage in battles of this sort it is not requisite to be a dubbed\\nknight.\"',\n",
       " '\"That I can well understand,\" answered Sancho; \"but where shall we put\\nthis ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for I\\nbelieve it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of\\nthis kind.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and what you had best do with him is\\nto leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses\\nwe shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even\\nRocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me\\nand observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights\\nwho accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and\\nmark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both\\narmies may be seen.\"',\n",

       " '\"That knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his\\nshield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant\\nLaurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of\\ngold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is\\nthe dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic\\nframe, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de\\nBoliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent\\nskin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one of\\nthose of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his death\\nhe revenged himself upon his enemies. But turn thine eyes to the other\\nside, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the\\never victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New\\nBiscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and\\nyellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto\\nwhich says Miau, which is the beginning of the name of his lady, who\\naccording to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke\\nAlfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins\\nof that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank\\nand without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres\\nPapin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with\\niron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra,\\nand for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia,\\nEspartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an\\nasparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, Rastrea mi suerte.\"\\nAnd so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other\\nout of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms,\\ncolours, devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his\\nunheard-of craze; and without a pause, he continued, \"People of divers\\nnations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the\\nsweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian\\nplains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that\\nenjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many\\nand various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the\\nNumidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery,\\nthe Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever\\nshift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the\\nEthiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose\\nfeatures I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names. In\\nthis other squadron there come those that drink of the crystal streams of\\nthe olive-bearing Betis, those that make smooth their countenances with\\nthe water of the ever rich and golden Tagus, those that rejoice in the\\nfertilising flow of the divine Genil, those that roam the Tartesian\\nplains abounding in pasture, those that take their pleasure in the\\nElysian meadows of Jerez, the rich Manchegans crowned with ruddy ears of\\ncorn, the wearers of iron, old relics of the Gothic race, those that\\nbathe in the Pisuerga renowned for its gentle current, those that feed\\ntheir herds along the spreading pastures of the winding Guadiana famed\\nfor its hidden course, those that tremble with the cold of the pineclad\\nPyrenees or the dazzling snows of the lofty Apennine; in a word, as many\\nas all Europe includes and contains.\"',\n",

       " \"So saying, he dashed into the midst of the squadron of ewes, and began\\nspearing them with as much spirit and intrepidity as if he were\\ntransfixing mortal enemies in earnest. The shepherds and drovers\\naccompanying the flock shouted to him to desist; seeing it was no use,\\nthey ungirt their slings and began to salute his ears with stones as big\\nas one's fist. Don Quixote gave no heed to the stones, but, letting drive\\nright and left kept saying:\",\n",
       " '\"Where art thou, proud Alifanfaron? Come before me; I am a single knight\\nwho would fain prove thy prowess hand to hand, and make thee yield thy\\nlife a penalty for the wrong thou dost to the valiant Pentapolin\\nGaramanta.\" Here came a sugar-plum from the brook that struck him on the\\nside and buried a couple of ribs in his body. Feeling himself so smitten,\\nhe imagined himself slain or badly wounded for certain, and recollecting\\nhis liquor he drew out his flask, and putting it to his mouth began to\\npour the contents into his stomach; but ere he had succeeded in\\nswallowing what seemed to him enough, there came another almond which\\nstruck him on the hand and on the flask so fairly that it smashed it to\\npieces, knocking three or four teeth and grinders out of his mouth in its\\ncourse, and sorely crushing two fingers of his hand. Such was the force\\nof the first blow and of the second, that the poor knight in spite of\\nhimself came down backwards off his horse. The shepherds came up, and\\nfelt sure they had killed him; so in all haste they collected their flock\\ntogether, took up the dead beasts, of which there were more than seven,\\nand made off without waiting to ascertain anything further.',\n",

But go not just yet, for I want thy help and assistance;\\ncome hither, and see how many of my teeth and grinders are missing, for I\\nfeel as if there was not one left in my mouth.\"',\n",
       " 'Sancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now just\\nat that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote, so, at\\nthe very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he discharged all\\nits contents with more force than a musket, and full into the beard of\\nthe compassionate squire.',\n",
       " '\"Holy Mary!\" cried Sancho, \"what is this that has happened me? Clearly\\nthis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;\" but\\nconsidering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the colour,\\ntaste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the flask\\nwhich he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a loathing that\\nhis stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his very master,\\nand both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his ass to get\\nsomething wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his\\nalforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses,\\nand cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and\\nreturn home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all\\nhopes of the promised island.',\n",

       " '\"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he\\ndoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs\\nthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\\nus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence it\\nfollows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh at\\nhand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which happen\\nto me, since thou hast no share in them.\"',\n",

       " '\"Thou art very right, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"but to tell the truth,\\nit had escaped my memory; and likewise thou mayest rely upon it that the\\naffair of the blanket happened to thee because of thy fault in not\\nreminding me of it in time; but I will make amends, for there are ways of\\ncompounding for everything in the order of chivalry.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why! have I taken an oath of some sort, then?\" said Sancho.',\n",
       " '\"It makes no matter that thou hast not taken an oath,\" said Don Quixote;\\n\"suffice it that I see thou art not quite clear of complicity; and\\nwhether or no, it will not be ill done to provide ourselves with a\\nremedy.\"',\n",

       " \"While engaged in this and other talk, night overtook them on the road\\nbefore they had reached or discovered any place of shelter; and what made\\nit still worse was that they were dying of hunger, for with the loss of\\nthe alforjas they had lost their entire larder and commissariat; and to\\ncomplete the misfortune they met with an adventure which without any\\ninvention had really the appearance of one. It so happened that the night\\nclosed in somewhat darkly, but for all that they pushed on, Sancho\\nfeeling sure that as the road was the king's highway they might\\nreasonably expect to find some inn within a league or two. Going along,\\nthen, in this way, the night dark, the squire hungry, the master\\nsharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road they were travelling\\na great number of lights which looked exactly like stars in motion.\\nSancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did Don Quixote\\naltogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the halter, the\\nother his hack by the bridle, and they stood still, watching anxiously to\\nsee what all this would turn out to be, and found that the lights were\\napproaching them, and the nearer they came the greater they seemed, at\\nwhich spectacle Sancho began to shake like a man dosed with mercury, and\\nDon Quixote's hair stood on end; he, however, plucking up spirit a\\nlittle, said:\",\n",
       " '\"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure, in\\nwhich it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and\\nresolution.\"',\n",
       " '\"Unlucky me!\" answered Sancho; \"if this adventure happens to be one of\\nphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs\\nto bear it?\"',\n",
       " '\"Be they phantoms ever so much,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will not permit\\nthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with\\nthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of\\nthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to wield\\nmy sword as I please.\"',\n",
       " '\"And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,\" said\\nSancho, \"what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?\"',\n",
       " '\"For all that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a\\ngood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will, please God,\" answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side\\nof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving\\nlights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty\\nencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\\nawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of\\nSancho, who began to chatter with his teeth like one in the cold fit of\\nan ague; and his heart sank and his teeth chattered still more when they\\nperceived distinctly that behind them there came a litter covered over\\nwith black and followed by six more mounted figures in mourning down to\\nthe very feet of their mules--for they could perceive plainly they were\\nnot horses by the easy pace at which they went. And as the encamisados\\ncame along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive tone. This\\nstrange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary place was quite\\nenough to strike terror into Sancho\\'s heart, and even into his master\\'s;\\nand (save in Don Quixote\\'s case) did so, for all Sancho\\'s resolution had\\nnow broken down. It was just the opposite with his master, whose\\nimagination immediately conjured up all this to him vividly as one of the\\nadventures of his books.',\n",
       " 'He took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\\nsome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\\nfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\\nrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\\nbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\\nencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\\nhand he raised his voice and said:',\n",
       " '\"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\\nare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\\nfor, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\\nwrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I should\\nknow, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done, or else\\nthat I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted upon you.\"',\n",
       " '\"We are in haste,\" answered one of the encamisados, \"and the inn is far\\noff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\" and\\nspurring his mule he moved on.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule by\\nthe bridle he said, \"Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an account of\\nwhat I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat, all of you.\"',\n",
       " 'The mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\\nrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\\nattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse Don\\nQuixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance\\nin rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded\\nto the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with\\nwhich he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just\\nas if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so lightly and proudly\\ndid he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so\\nthey speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across\\nthe plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers\\nrunning on some gala or festival night. The mourners, too, enveloped and\\nswathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and\\nso with entire safety to himself Don Quixote belaboured them all and\\ndrove them off against their will, for they all thought it was no man but\\na devil from hell come to carry away the dead body they had in the\\nlitter.',\n",
       " 'Sancho beheld all this in astonishment at the intrepidity of his lord,\\nand said to himself, \"Clearly this master of mine is as bold and valiant\\nas he says he is.\"',\n",

       " '\"There is no occasion, senor, for wasting time or money on making that\\ncountenance,\" said Sancho; \"for all that need be done is for your worship\\nto show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without\\nanything more, either image or shield, they will call you \\'Him of the\\nRueful Countenance\\' and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I\\nassure you, senor (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of\\nyour grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say,\\nthe rueful picture may be very well spared.\"',\n",

       " \"The advice seemed good to Don Quixote, and, he leading Rocinante by the\\nbridle and Sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon\\nhim the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their\\nway, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;\\nbut they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if\\nfalling from great rocks, struck their ears. The sound cheered them\\ngreatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came\\nthey heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the satisfaction the\\nsound of the water gave them, especially for Sancho, who was by nature\\ntimid and faint-hearted. They heard, I say, strokes falling with a\\nmeasured beat, and a certain rattling of iron and chains that, together\\nwith the furious din of the water, would have struck terror into any\\nheart but Don Quixote's. The night was, as has been said, dark, and they\\nhad happened to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves\\nstirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with\\nthe solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the\\nrustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more\\nespecially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind\\nlull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance\\nas to where they were.\",\n",
       " 'But Don Quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on Rocinante,\\nand bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and\\nsaid, \"Friend Sancho, know that I by Heaven\\'s will have been born in this\\nour iron age to revive revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it\\nis called; I am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant\\ndeeds are reserved; I am, I say again, he who is to revive the Knights of\\nthe Round Table, the Twelve of France and the Nine Worthies; and he who\\nis to consign to oblivion the Platirs, the Tablantes, the Olivantes and\\nTirantes, the Phoebuses and Belianises, with the whole herd of famous\\nknights-errant of days gone by, performing in these in which I live such\\nexploits, marvels, and feats of arms as shall obscure their brightest\\ndeeds. Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the gloom of this\\nnight, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of those trees, the\\nawful sound of that water in quest of which we came, that seems as though\\nit were precipitating and dashing itself down from the lofty mountains of\\nthe Moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears;\\nwhich things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear,\\ndread, and dismay into the breast of Mars himself, much more into one not\\nused to hazards and adventures of the kind. Well, then, all this that I\\nput before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my\\nheart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure,\\narduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten Rocinante\\'s girths a\\nlittle, and God be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more,\\nand if in that time I come not back, thou canst return to our village,\\nand thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso,\\nwhere thou shalt say to my incomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive\\nknight hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being\\ncalled hers.\"',\n",

I\\nleft home and wife and children to come and serve your worship, trusting\\nto do better and not worse; but as covetousness bursts the bag, it has\\nrent my hopes asunder, for just as I had them highest about getting that\\nwretched unlucky island your worship has so often promised me, I see that\\ninstead and in lieu of it you mean to desert me now in a place so far\\nfrom human reach: for God\\'s sake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by\\nme, and if your worship will not entirely give up attempting this feat,\\nat least put it off till morning, for by what the lore I learned when I\\nwas a shepherd tells me it cannot want three hours of dawn now, because\\nthe mouth of the Horn is overhead and makes midnight in the line of the\\nleft arm.\"',\n",
       " '\"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it makes that\\nline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when\\nthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\\nheaven?\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things\\nunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason to\\nshow that it now wants but little of day.\"',\n",
       " '\"Let it want what it may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said of\\nme now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing\\nwhat was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee, Sancho,\\nto hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to undertake now\\nthis so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over\\nmy safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten\\nRocinante\\'s girths well, and wait here, for I shall come back shortly,\\nalive or dead.\"',\n",
       " \"Sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his\\ntears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have\\nrecourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till\\ndaylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly\\nand without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both Rocinante's legs,\\nso that when Don Quixote strove to go he was unable as the horse could\\nonly move by jumps. Seeing the success of his trick, Sancho Panza said:\",\n",
       " '\"See there, senor! Heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered\\nit that Rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and\\nstrike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against\\nthe pricks.\"',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into\\nthe horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of the\\ntying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until\\nRocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something\\nother than Sancho\\'s ingenuity. So he said to him, \"As it is so, Sancho,\\nand as Rocinante cannot move, I am content to wait till dawn smiles upon\\nus, even though I weep while it delays its coming.\"',\n",
       " '\"There is no need to weep,\" answered Sancho, \"for I will amuse your\\nworship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you\\nlike to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after\\nthe fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the\\nmoment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are\\nlooking forward to.\"',\n",
       " '\"What art thou talking about dismounting or sleeping for?\" said Don\\nQuixote. \"Am I, thinkest thou, one of those knights that take their rest\\nin the presence of danger?

       " '\"Be not angry, master mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say\\nthat;\" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the\\nsaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master\\'s left\\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger\\'s width from him;\\nso much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a regular\\nbeat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he had\\nproposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of what he\\nheard would let him; \"Still,\" said he, \"I will strive to tell a story\\nwhich, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with the\\ntelling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your\\nattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is to\\ncome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it--your\\nworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their\\ntales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato Zonzorino\\nthe Roman, that says \\'the evil for him that goes to look for it,\\' and it\\ncomes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show that your\\nworship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any quarter, and\\nthat we should go back by some other road, since nobody forces us to\\nfollow this in which so many terrors affright us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Go on with thy story, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and leave the choice\\nof our road to my care.\"',\n",
       " '\"I say then,\" continued Sancho, \"that in a village of Estremadura there\\nwas a goat-shepherd--that is to say, one who tended goats--which shepherd\\nor goatherd, as my story goes, was called Lope Ruiz, and this Lope Ruiz\\nwas in love with a shepherdess called Torralva, which shepherdess called\\nTorralva was the daughter of a rich grazier, and this rich grazier-\"',\n",
       " '\"If that is the way thou tellest thy tale, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\\n\"repeating twice all thou hast to say, thou wilt not have done these two\\ndays; go straight on with it, and tell it like a reasonable man, or else\\nsay nothing.\"',\n",
       " '\"Tales are always told in my country in the very way I am telling this,\"\\nanswered Sancho, \"and I cannot tell it in any other, nor is it right of\\nyour worship to ask me to make new customs.\"',\n",
       " '\"Tell it as thou wilt,\" replied Don Quixote; \"and as fate will have it\\nthat I cannot help listening to thee, go on.\"',\n",
       " '\"And so, lord of my soul,\" continued Sancho, as I have said, this\\nshepherd was in love with Torralva the shepherdess, who was a wild buxom\\nlass with something of the look of a man about her, for she had little\\nmoustaches; I fancy I see her now.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then you knew her?\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I did not know her,\" said Sancho, \"but he who told me the story said it\\nwas so true and certain that when I told it to another I might safely\\ndeclare and swear I had seen it all myself. And so in course of time, the\\ndevil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion, contrived that\\nthe love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into hatred and\\nill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was some little\\njealousy she caused him that crossed the line and trespassed on forbidden\\nground; and so much did the shepherd hate her from that time forward\\nthat, in order to escape from her, he determined to quit the country and\\ngo where he should never set eyes on her again. Torralva, when she found\\nherself spurned by Lope, was immediately smitten with love for him,\\nthough she had never loved him before.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is the natural way of women,\" said Don Quixote, \"to scorn the one\\nthat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.\"',\n",
       " '\"It came to pass,\" said Sancho, \"that the shepherd carried out his\\nintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the\\nplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.\\nTorralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot\\nfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim\\'s staff in her hand and a\\nscrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of\\nlooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of paint\\nfor her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to trouble\\nmyself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say, came with\\nhis flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that time\\nswollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came to\\nthere was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his flock to\\nthe other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived that\\nTorralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with her\\ntears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely that he\\ndiscovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small that it\\ncould only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he spoke to him\\nand agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred goats across.\\nThe fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he came back\\nand carried another over; he came back again, and again brought over\\nanother--let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking\\nacross, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story,\\nand it will be impossible to tell another word of it. To proceed, I must\\ntell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and\\nthe fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he\\nreturned for another goat, and another, and another.\"',\n",
       " '\"Take it for granted he brought them all across,\" said Don Quixote, \"and\\ndon\\'t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of\\nbringing them over this twelvemonth.\"',\n",
       " '\"How many have gone across so far?\" said Sancho.',\n",
       " '\"How the devil do I know?\" replied Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"There it is,\" said Sancho, \"what I told you, that you must keep a good\\ncount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no\\ngoing any farther.\"',\n",
       " '\"How can that be?\" said Don Quixote; \"is it so essential to the story to\\nknow to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be a\\nmistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?\"',\n",
       " '\"No, senor, not a bit,\" replied Sancho; \"for when I asked your worship to\\ntell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, at\\nthat very instant all I had to say passed away out of my memory, and,\\nfaith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\"',\n",
       " '\"So, then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the story has come to an end?\"',\n",
       " '\"As much as my mother has,\" said Sancho.',\n",
       " '\"In truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast told one of the rarest stories,\\ntales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have imagined, and\\nsuch a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a\\nlifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy excellent\\nunderstanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes\\nmay have confused thy wits.\"',\n",
       " '\"All that may be,\" replied Sancho, \"but I know that as to my story, all\\nthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of\\nthe passage of the goats begins.\"',\n",
       " '\"Let it end where it will, well and good,\" said Don Quixote, \"and let us\\nsee if Rocinante can go;\" and again he spurred him, and again Rocinante\\nmade jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.',\n",
       " \"Just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now\\napproaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that\\nit was only natural (as is most likely), Sancho felt a desire to do what\\nno one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated\\nhis heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as\\nthe black of his nail; to escape doing what he wanted was, however, also\\nimpossible; so what he did for peace's sake was to remove his right hand,\\nwhich held the back of the saddle, and with it to untie gently and\\nsilently the running string which alone held up his breeches, so that on\\nloosening it they at once fell down round his feet like fetters; he then\\nraised his shirt as well as he could and bared his hind quarters, no slim\\nones. But, this accomplished, which he fancied was all he had to do to\\nget out of this terrible strait and embarrassment, another still greater\\ndifficulty presented itself, for it seemed to him impossible to relieve\\nhimself without making some noise, and he ground his teeth and squeezed\\nhis shoulders together, holding his breath as much as he could; but in\\nspite of his precautions he was unlucky enough after all to make a little\\nnoise, very different from that which was causing him so much fear.\",\n",
       " 'Don Quixote, hearing it, said, \"What noise is that, Sancho?\"',\n",
       " '\"I don\\'t know, senor,\" said he; \"it must be something new, for adventures\\nand misadventures never begin with a trifle.\" Once more he tried his\\nluck, and succeeded so well, that without any further noise or\\ndisturbance he found himself relieved of the burden that had given him so\\nmuch discomfort. But as Don Quixote\\'s sense of smell was as acute as his\\nhearing, and as Sancho was so closely linked with him that the fumes rose\\nalmost in a straight line, it could not be but that some should reach his\\nnose, and as soon as they did he came to its relief by compressing it\\nbetween his fingers, saying in a rather snuffing tone, \"Sancho, it\\nstrikes me thou art in great fear.\"',\n",
       " '\"I am,\" answered Sancho; \"but how does your worship perceive it now more\\nthan ever?\"',\n",
       " '\"Because just now thou smellest stronger than ever, and not of\\nambergris,\" answered Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"Very likely,\" said Sancho, \"but that\\'s not my fault, but your worship\\'s,\\nfor leading me about at unseasonable hours and at such unwonted paces.\"',\n",
       " '\"Then go back three or four, my friend,\" said Don Quixote, all the time\\nwith his fingers to his nose; \"and for the future pay more attention to\\nthy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity\\nwith thee that has bred this contempt.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ll bet,\" replied Sancho, \"that your worship thinks I have done\\nsomething I ought not with my person.\"',\n",
       " '\"It makes it worse to stir it, friend Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote.',\n",
       " \"With this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the\\nnight, till Sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very\\ncautiously untied Rocinante and tied up his breeches. As soon as\\nRocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all\\nmettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as to\\ncapering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. Don Quixote,\\nthen, observing that Rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a\\nsignal that he should attempt the dread adventure. By this time day had\\nfully broken and everything showed distinctly, and Don Quixote saw that\\nhe was among some tall trees, chestnuts, which cast a very deep shade; he\\nperceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but could\\nnot discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he let\\nRocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of Sancho, he told\\nhim to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said before, and\\nif he should not have returned by that time, he might feel sure it had\\nbeen God's will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure.\\nHe again repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on\\nhis behalf to his lady Dulcinea, and said he was not to be uneasy as to\\nthe payment of his services, for before leaving home he had made his\\nwill, in which he would find himself fully recompensed in the matter of\\nwages in due proportion to the time he had served; but if God delivered\\nhim safe, sound, and unhurt out of that danger, he might look upon the\\npromised island as much more than certain. Sancho began to weep afresh on\\nagain hearing the affecting words of his good master, and resolved to\\nstay with him until the final issue and end of the business. From these\\ntears and this honourable resolve of Sancho Panza's the author of this\\nhistory infers that he must have been of good birth and at least an old\\nChristian; and the feeling he displayed touched his but not so much as to\\nmake him show any weakness; on the contrary, hiding what he felt as well\\nas he could, he began to move towards that quarter whence the sound of\\nthe water and of the strokes seemed to come.\",\n",
       " 'Sancho followed him on foot, leading by the halter, as his custom was,\\nhis ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing\\nsome distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little\\nmeadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water\\nflung itself. At the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed\\nhouses looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they\\nperceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without\\nintermission. Rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the\\nblows, but quieting him Don Quixote advanced step by step towards the\\nhouses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her\\nsupport in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending\\nhimself to God, too, not to forget him. Sancho who never quitted his\\nside, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs\\nof Rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him\\nsuch fear and apprehension. They went it might be a hundred paces\\nfarther, when on turning a corner the true cause, beyond the possibility\\nof any mistake, of that dread-sounding and to them awe-inspiring noise\\nthat had kept them all the night in such fear and perplexity, appeared\\nplain and obvious; and it was (if, reader, thou art not disgusted and\\ndisappointed) six fulling hammers which by their alternate strokes made\\nall the din.',\n",
       " 'When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid from\\nhead to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent down\\nupon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced at\\nSancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\\nlaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\\nvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when Sancho\\nsaw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold his sides\\nwith both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter. Four times\\nhe stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the\\nsame violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all\\nwhen he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho, that of\\nHeaven\\'s will I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden\\nor age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty\\nachievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on repeating the words\\nthat Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was\\nso mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such\\nblows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught\\nthem on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to\\nhis heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest\\nfor his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said\\nto him very humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, then, if you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look\\nhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\\nhad been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being,\\nas I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell\\nwhether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as\\nis the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as\\nyou are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn me these six\\nhammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one by one or all\\ntogether, and if I do not knock them head over heels, then make what\\nmockery you like of me.\"',\n",
       " '\"No more of that, senor,\" returned Sancho; \"I own I went a little too far\\nwith the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made between\\nus (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may befall you\\nas safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one), was it not a\\nthing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great fear we were\\nin?--at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see now that you\\nneither know nor understand what either fear or dismay is.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be worth\\nlaughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is not\\neveryone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\"',\n",
       " '\"At any rate,\" said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right point\\nwith your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the shoulders, thanks\\nbe to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let that pass; all will\\ncome out in the scouring; for I have heard say \\'he loves thee well that\\nmakes thee weep;\\' and moreover that it is the way with great lords after\\nany hard words they give a servant to give him a pair of breeches; though\\nI do not know what they give after blows, unless it be that\\nknights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms on the mainland.\"',\n",
       " '\"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest will\\ncome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that our\\nfirst movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the future\\nbear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my company;\\nfor in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they are\\ninnumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his lord as\\nthou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault of thine\\nand of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for me; of mine,\\nthat I do not make myself more respected. There was Gandalin, the squire\\nof Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula Firme, and we read of him\\nthat he always addressed his lord with his cap in his hand, his head\\nbowed down and his body bent double, more turquesco. And then, what shall\\nwe say of Gasabal, the squire of Galaor, who was so silent that in order\\nto indicate to us the greatness of his marvellous taciturnity his name is\\nonly once mentioned in the whole of that history, as long as it is\\ntruthful? From all I have said thou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must\\nbe a difference between master and man, between lord and lackey, between\\nknight and squire: so that from this day forward in our intercourse we\\nmust observe more respect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I\\nmay be provoked with you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and\\nbenefits that I have promised you will come in due time, and if they do\\nnot your wages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.\"',\n",
       " '\"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \"but I should\\nlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\\nbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\\nthe day like bricklayers?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that such squires were ever on\\nwages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned thine in\\nthe sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to what may\\nhappen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in these\\nwretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for trifles\\nin the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in this\\nthere is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a\\nfulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant errant\\nadventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open my lips\\nhenceforward to make light of anything of your worship\\'s, but only to\\nhonour you as my master and natural lord.\"',\n",
       " '\"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long on the face of\\nthe earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as though\\nthey were parents.\"',\n",

       " '\\nIt now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling\\nmills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of\\nthe late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning\\naside to right they came upon another road, different from that which\\nthey had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived\\na man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold,\\nand the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said:',\n",
       " '\"I think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims\\ndrawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially\\nthat one that says, \\'Where one door shuts, another opens.\\' I say so\\nbecause if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were\\nlooking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens\\nwide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I\\ndo not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it\\nto my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say\\nthis because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on\\nhis head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou\\nrememberest.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\" said\\nSancho, \"for I don\\'t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling\\nand knocking our senses out.\"',\n",

       " '\"I don\\'t know,\" replied Sancho, \"but, faith, if I might speak as I used,\\nperhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were\\nmistaken in what you say.\"',\n",
       " '\"How can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\" returned Don\\nQuixote; \"tell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a\\ndappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\"',\n",

       " '\"Well, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\" said Don Quixote; \"stand to one\\nside and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a\\nword, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess\\nmyself of the helmet I have so longed for.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will take care to stand aside,\" said Sancho; \"but God grant, I say\\nonce more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\"',\n",
       " '\"I have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills\\nto me again,\" said Don Quixote, \"or I vow--and I say no more-I\\'ll full\\nthe soul out of you.\"',\n",
       " 'Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow\\nhe had hurled like a bowl at him.',\n",
       " \"The fact of the matter as regards the helmet, steed, and knight that Don\\nQuixote saw, was this. In that neighbourhood there were two villages, one\\nof them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop nor barber, which\\nthe other that was close to it had, so the barber of the larger served\\nthe smaller, and in it there was a sick man who required to be bled and\\nanother man who wanted to be shaved, and on this errand the barber was\\ngoing, carrying with him a brass basin; but as luck would have it, as he\\nwas on the way it began to rain, and not to spoil his hat, which probably\\nwas a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered\\nat half a league's distance. He rode upon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and\\nthis was what made it seem to Don Quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a\\nknight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with\\nhis crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor\\nknight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at\\nRocinante's top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low,\\nfully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him,\\nwithout checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:\",\n",
       " '\"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\\nwhich is so reasonably my due.\"',\n",
       " 'The barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this\\napparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself from\\nthe stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and no\\nsooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than a\\ndeer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.',\n",
       " 'He left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\\nhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated the\\nbeaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts off\\nwith its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it is\\npursued.',\n",
       " 'He told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands said:',\n",
       " '\"By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is worth\\na maravedis,\" and handed it to his master, who immediately put it on his\\nhead, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of fitment, and\\nnot finding it he said, \"Clearly the pagan to whose measure this famous\\nhead-piece was first forged must have had a very large head; but the\\nworst of it is half of it is wanting.\"',\n",
       " \"When Sancho heard him call the basin a headpiece he was unable to\\nrestrain his laughter, but remembering his master's wrath he checked\\nhimself in the midst of it.\",\n",
       " '\"What art thou laughing at, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I am laughing,\" said he, \"to think of the great head the pagan must have\\nhad who owned this helmet, for it looks exactly like a regular barber\\'s\\nbasin.\"',\n",
       " '\"Dost thou know what I suspect, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote; \"that this\\nwonderful piece of this enchanted helmet must by some strange accident\\nhave come into the hands of some one who was unable to recognise or\\nrealise its value, and who, not knowing what he did, and seeing it to be\\nof the purest gold, must have melted down one half for the sake of what\\nit might be worth, and of the other made this which is like a barber\\'s\\nbasin as thou sayest; but be it as it may, to me who recognise it, its\\ntransformation makes no difference, for I will set it to rights at the\\nfirst village where there is a blacksmith, and in such style that that\\nhelmet the god of smithies forged for the god of battles shall not\\nsurpass it or even come up to it; and in the meantime I will wear it as\\nwell as I can, for something is better than nothing; all the more as it\\nwill be quite enough to protect me from any chance blow of a stone.\"',\n",
       " '\"That is,\" said Sancho, \"if it is not shot with a sling as they were in\\nthe battle of the two armies, when they signed the cross on your\\nworship\\'s grinders and smashed the flask with that blessed draught that\\nmade me vomit my bowels up.\"',\n",
       " '\"It does not grieve me much to have lost it,\" said Don Quixote, \"for thou\\nknowest, Sancho, that I have the receipt in my memory.\"',\n",
       " '\"So have I,\" answered Sancho, \"but if ever I make it, or try it again as\\nlong as I live, may this be my last hour; moreover, I have no intention\\nof putting myself in the way of wanting it, for I mean, with all my five\\nsenses, to keep myself from being wounded or from wounding anyone: as to\\nbeing blanketed again I say nothing, for it is hard to prevent mishaps of\\nthat sort, and if they come there is nothing for it but to squeeze our\\nshoulders together, hold our breath, shut our eyes, and let ourselves go\\nwhere luck and the blanket may send us.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thou art a bad Christian, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote on hearing this,\\n\"for once an injury has been done thee thou never forgettest it: but know\\nthat it is the part of noble and generous hearts not to attach importance\\nto trifles. What lame leg hast thou got by it, what broken rib, what\\ncracked head, that thou canst not forget that jest? For jest and sport it\\nwas, properly regarded, and had I not seen it in that light I would have\\nreturned and done more mischief in revenging thee than the Greeks did for\\nthe rape of Helen, who, if she were alive now, or if my Dulcinea had\\nlived then, might depend upon it she would not be so famous for her\\nbeauty as she is;\" and here he heaved a sigh and sent it aloft; and said\\nSancho, \"Let it pass for a jest as it cannot be revenged in earnest, but\\nI know what sort of jest and earnest it was, and I know it will never be\\nrubbed out of my memory any more than off my shoulders. But putting that\\naside, will your worship tell me what are we to do with this dapple-grey\\nsteed that looks like a grey ass, which that Martino that your worship\\noverthrew has left deserted here? for, from the way he took to his heels\\nand bolted, he is not likely ever to come back for it; and by my beard\\nbut the grey is a good one.\"',\n",
       " '\"I have never been in the habit,\" said Don Quixote, \"of taking spoil of\\nthose whom I vanquish, nor is it the practice of chivalry to take away\\ntheir horses and leave them to go on foot, unless indeed it be that the\\nvictor have lost his own in the combat, in which case it is lawful to\\ntake that of the vanquished as a thing won in lawful war; therefore,\\nSancho, leave this horse, or ass, or whatever thou wilt have it to be;\\nfor when its owner sees us gone hence he will come back for it.\"',\n",
       " '\"God knows I should like to take it,\" returned Sancho, \"or at least to\\nchange it for my own, which does not seem to me as good a one: verily the\\nlaws of chivalry are strict, since they cannot be stretched to let one\\nass be changed for another; I should like to know if I might at least\\nchange trappings.\"',\n",
       " '\"On that head I am not quite certain,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and the\\nmatter being doubtful, pending better information, I say thou mayest\\nchange them, if so be thou hast urgent need of them.\"',\n",
       " '\"So urgent is it,\" answered Sancho, \"that if they were for my own person\\nI could not want them more;\" and forthwith, fortified by this licence, he\\neffected the mutatio capparum, rigging out his beast to the ninety-nines\\nand making quite another thing of it. This done, they broke their fast on\\nthe remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule, and\\ndrank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a\\nlook in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm\\nthey had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and,\\nwithout taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing\\nfor true knights-errant), they set out, guided by Rocinante\\'s will, which\\ncarried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,\\nwhich always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;\\nnevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture\\nwithout any other aim.',\n",
       " 'As they went along, then, in this way Sancho said to his master, \"Senor,\\nwould your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? For since you\\nlaid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to\\nrot in my stomach, and I have now just one on the tip of my tongue that I\\ndon\\'t want to be spoiled.\"',\n",
       " '\"Say, on, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and be brief in thy discourse, for\\nthere is no pleasure in one that is long.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well then, senor,\" returned Sancho, \"I say that for some days past I\\nhave been considering how little is got or gained by going in search of\\nthese adventures that your worship seeks in these wilds and cross-roads,\\nwhere, even if the most perilous are victoriously achieved, there is no\\none to see or know of them, and so they must be left untold for ever, to\\nthe loss of your worship\\'s object and the credit they deserve; therefore\\nit seems to me it would be better (saving your worship\\'s better judgment)\\nif we were to go and serve some emperor or other great prince who may\\nhave some war on hand, in whose service your worship may prove the worth\\nof your person, your great might, and greater understanding, on\\nperceiving which the lord in whose service we may be will perforce have\\nto reward us, each according to his merits; and there you will not be at\\na loss for some one to set down your achievements in writing so as to\\npreserve their memory for ever. Of my own I say nothing, as they will not\\ngo beyond squirely limits, though I make bold to say that, if it be the\\npractice in chivalry to write the achievements of squires, I think mine\\nmust not be left out.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thou speakest not amiss, Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"but before that\\npoint is reached it is requisite to roam the world, as it were on\\nprobation, seeking adventures, in order that, by achieving some, name and\\nfame may be acquired, such that when he betakes himself to the court of\\nsome great monarch the knight may be already known by his deeds, and that\\nthe boys, the instant they see him enter the gate of the city, may all\\nfollow him and surround him, crying, \\'This is the Knight of the Sun\\'-or\\nthe Serpent, or any other title under which he may have achieved great\\ndeeds. \\'This,\\' they will say, \\'is he who vanquished in single combat the\\ngigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength; he who delivered the great\\nMameluke of Persia out of the long enchantment under which he had been\\nfor almost nine hundred years.\\' So from one to another they will go\\nproclaiming his achievements; and presently at the tumult of the boys and\\nthe others the king of that kingdom will appear at the windows of his\\nroyal palace, and as soon as he beholds the knight, recognising him by\\nhis arms and the device on his shield, he will as a matter of course say,\\n\\'What ho! Forth all ye, the knights of my court, to receive the flower of\\nchivalry who cometh hither!\\' At which command all will issue forth, and\\nhe himself, advancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely,\\nand salute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\\nqueen\\'s chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\\ndaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished damsels\\nthat could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the known\\nworld. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her eyes upon\\nthe knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the other something\\nmore divine than human, and, without knowing how or why they will be\\ntaken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and sorely\\ndistressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their pains and\\nsufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no doubt, to some\\nrichly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having removed his armour,\\nthey will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet wherewith to robe himself,\\nand if he looked noble in his armour he will look still more so in a\\ndoublet. When night comes he will sup with the king, queen, and princess;\\nand all the time he will never take his eyes off her, stealing stealthy\\nglances, unnoticed by those present, and she will do the same, and with\\nequal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a damsel of great discretion.\\nThe tables being removed, suddenly through the door of the hall there\\nwill enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf followed by a fair dame,\\nbetween two giants, who comes with a certain adventure, the work of an\\nancient sage; and he who shall achieve it shall be deemed the best knight\\nin the world.',\n",
       " '\"The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none will\\nbring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the great\\nenhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed and will\\nesteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed her\\nthoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or\\nwhatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful\\nas himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his\\ncourt, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The\\nking will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his\\nhands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of\\nhis lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps,\\nwhich looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times\\nconversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a\\ndamsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the\\ndamsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and\\nfor the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at\\nlast the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands\\nthrough the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a\\nthousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between\\nthem how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes,\\nand the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as\\npossible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he\\nkisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh\\nready to die. He betakes him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his\\nbed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes\\nto take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his\\nleave of the pair, it is told him that the princess is indisposed and\\ncannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his\\ndeparture, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from\\nshowing his pain. The confidante is present, observes all, goes to tell\\nher mistress, who listens with tears and says that one of her greatest\\ndistresses is not knowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly\\nlineage or not; the damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness,\\nand gallantry of bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any\\nsave one who was royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and\\nshe strives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her\\nparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile the\\nknight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the king\\'s\\nenemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to the court,\\nsees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed that he\\nshall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his\\nservices; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he is,\\nbut nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be,\\nthe princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard it as\\nvery good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the\\nson of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is\\nnot likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and\\nin two words the knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the\\nbestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising\\nto so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the\\nprincess\\'s, who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their\\namour, and is daughter of a very great duke.\"',\n",
       " '\"That\\'s what I want, and no mistake about it!\" said Sancho. \"That\\'s what\\nI\\'m waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your\\nworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for in the same\\nmanner, and by the same steps as I have described here, knights-errant\\nrise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we want now is to find\\nout what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and has a beautiful\\ndaughter; but there will be time enough to think of that, for, as I have\\ntold thee, fame must be won in other quarters before repairing to the\\ncourt. There is another thing, too, that is wanting; for supposing we\\nfind a king who is at war and has a beautiful daughter, and that I have\\nwon incredible fame throughout the universe, I know not how it can be\\nmade out that I am of royal lineage, or even second cousin to an emperor;\\nfor the king will not be willing to give me his daughter in marriage\\nunless he is first thoroughly satisfied on this point, however much my\\nfamous deeds may deserve it; so that by this deficiency I fear I shall\\nlose what my arm has fairly earned. True it is I am a gentleman of known\\nhouse, of estate and property, and entitled to the five hundred sueldos\\nmulct; and it may be that the sage who shall write my history will so\\nclear up my ancestry and pedigree that I may find myself fifth or sixth\\nin descent from a king; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that there\\nare two kinds of lineages in the world; some there be tracing and\\nderiving their descent from kings and princes, whom time has reduced\\nlittle by little until they end in a point like a pyramid upside down;\\nand others who spring from the common herd and go on rising step by step\\nuntil they come to be great lords; so that the difference is that the one\\nwere what they no longer are, and the others are what they formerly were\\nnot. And I may be of such that after investigation my origin may prove\\ngreat and famous, with which the king, my father-in-law that is to be,\\nought to be satisfied; and should he not be, the princess will so love me\\nthat even though she well knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she\\nwill take me for her lord and husband in spite of her father; if not,\\nthen it comes to seizing her and carrying her off where I please; for\\ntime or death will put an end to the wrath of her parents.\"',\n",
       " '\"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people say,\\n\\'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;\\' though it would\\nfit better to say, \\'A clear escape is better than good men\\'s prayers.\\' I\\nsay so because if my lord the king, your worship\\'s father-in-law, will\\nnot condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing for it\\nbut, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But the\\nmischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\\nenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as rewards\\ngo, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his wife comes\\nwith the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad luck until\\nHeaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose, may as well\\ngive her to him at once for a lawful wife.\"',\n",
       " '\"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"Then since that may be,\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to\\ncommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.\"',\n",
       " '\"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote,\\n\"and mean be he who thinks himself mean.\"',\n",
       " '\"In God\\'s name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old Christian, and\\nto fit me for a count that\\'s enough.\"',\n",
       " '\"And more than enough for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou\\nnot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\\ngive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for when\\nI make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they may say\\nwhat they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee \\'your\\nlordship,\\' whether they like it or not.\"',\n",
       " '\"Not a doubt of it; and I\\'ll know how to support the tittle,\" said\\nSancho.',\n",
       " '\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master.',\n",
       " '\"So be it,\" answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once\\nin my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle\\'s gown sat so\\nwell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\\nbrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke\\'s robe on my back,\\nor dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe they\\'ll come a\\nhundred leagues to see me.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard\\noften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou dost\\nnot shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou art at\\nthe distance of a musket shot.\"',\n",
       " '\"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than having a barber, and keeping\\nhim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\\ngo behind me like a nobleman\\'s equerry.\"',\n",
       " '\"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\" asked\\nDon Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month at the\\ncapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\\nsaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every\\nturn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not\\njoin the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me\\nthat he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have\\nsuch persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never\\nforgotten it.\"',\n",
       " '\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest\\ncarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\\ntogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one\\'s\\nbeard is a greater trust than saddling one\\'s horse.\"',\n",
       " '\"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said Sancho; \"and your\\nworship\\'s be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\"',\n",
       " '\"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what\\nwill be told in the following chapter.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '\\nCHAPTER XXII.',\n",
       " 'OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST\\nTHEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO',\n",
       " '\\nCide Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this\\nmost grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that\\nafter the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his\\nsquire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one,\\nDon Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was\\nfollowing some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads,\\non a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them\\nthere came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback\\nwith wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as\\nsoon as Sancho saw them he said:',\n",
       " '\"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of\\nthe king\\'s orders.\"',\n",
       " '\"How by force?\" asked Don Quixote; \"is it possible that the king uses\\nforce against anyone?\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not say that,\" answered Sancho, \"but that these are people\\ncondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king\\'s galleys.\"',\n",
       " '\"In fact,\" replied Don Quixote, \"however it may be, these people are\\ngoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.\"',\n",
       " '\"Just so,\" said Sancho.',\n",
       " '\"Then if so,\" said Don Quixote, \"here is a case for the exercise of my\\noffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\"',\n",
       " '\"Recollect, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"Justice, which is the king\\nhimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing\\nthem for their crimes.\"',\n",
       " 'The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in\\nvery courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good\\nenough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting\\nthese people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that\\nthey were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to\\nthe galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any\\nbusiness to know.',\n",
       " '\"Nevertheless,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I should like to know from each of\\nthem separately the reason of his misfortune;\" to this he added more to\\nthe same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that\\nthe other mounted guard said to him:',\n",
       " '\"Though we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of\\nevery one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read\\nthem; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they\\nwill, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about\\nrascalities.\"',\n",
       " 'With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they\\nnot granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what\\noffences he was now in such a sorry case.',\n",
       " 'He made answer that it was for being a lover.',\n",
       " '\"For that only?\" replied Don Quixote; \"why, if for being lovers they send\\npeople to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.\"',\n",
       " '\"The love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,\" said the galley\\nslave; \"mine was that I loved a washerwoman\\'s basket of clean linen so\\nwell, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had\\nnot forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to\\nthis moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture,\\nthe case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back,\\nand three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.\"',\n",
       " '\"What are gurapas?\" asked Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"Gurapas are galleys,\" answered the galley slave, who was a young man of\\nabout four-and-twenty, and said he was a native of Piedrahita.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote asked the same question of the second, who made no reply, so\\ndowncast and melancholy was he; but the first answered for him, and said,\\n\"He, sir, goes as a canary, I mean as a musician and a singer.\"',\n",
       " '\"What!\" said Don Quixote, \"for being musicians and singers are people\\nsent to the galleys too?\"',\n",
       " '\"Yes, sir,\" answered the galley slave, \"for there is nothing worse than\\nsinging under suffering.\"',\n",
       " '\"On the contrary, I have heard say,\" said Don Quixote, \"that he who sings\\nscares away his woes.\"',\n",
       " '\"Here it is the reverse,\" said the galley slave; \"for he who sings once\\nweeps all his life.\"',\n",
       " '\"I do not understand it,\" said Don Quixote; but one of the guards said to\\nhim, \"Sir, to sing under suffering means with the non sancta fraternity\\nto confess under torture; they put this sinner to the torture and he\\nconfessed his crime, which was being a cuatrero, that is a\\ncattle-stealer, and on his confession they sentenced him to six years in\\nthe galleys, besides two bundred lashes that he has already had on the\\nback; and he is always dejected and downcast because the other thieves\\nthat were left behind and that march here ill-treat, and snub, and jeer,\\nand despise him for confessing and not having spirit enough to say nay;\\nfor, say they, \\'nay\\' has no more letters in it than \\'yea,\\' and a culprit\\nis well off when life or death with him depends on his own tongue and not\\non that of witnesses or evidence; and to my thinking they are not very\\nfar out.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I think so too,\" answered Don Quixote; then passing on to the third\\nhe asked him what he had asked the others, and the man answered very\\nreadily and unconcernedly, \"I am going for five years to their ladyships\\nthe gurapas for the want of ten ducats.\"',\n",
       " '\"I will give twenty with pleasure to get you out of that trouble,\" said\\nDon Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"That,\" said the galley slave, \"is like a man having money at sea when he\\nis dying of hunger and has no way of buying what he wants; I say so\\nbecause if at the right time I had had those twenty ducats that your\\nworship now offers me, I would have greased the notary\\'s pen and\\nfreshened up the attorney\\'s wit with them, so that to-day I should be in\\nthe middle of the plaza of the Zocodover at Toledo, and not on this road\\ncoupled like a greyhound. But God is great; patience--there, that\\'s\\nenough of it.\"',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\\nwhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\\nreason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but the\\nfifth acted as his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to the\\ngalleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony and on\\nhorseback.\"',\n",
       " '\"That means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to\\nshame in public.\"',\n",
       " '\"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which they gave\\nhim that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay body-broker; I\\nmean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and for having\\nbesides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\"',\n",
       " '\"If that touch had not been thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not\\ndeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\\nand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one, being\\nthe office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a well-ordered\\nstate, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth; nay, there\\nought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other offices, and\\nrecognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this way many of the\\nevils would be avoided which are caused by this office and calling being\\nin the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as women more or less\\nsilly, and pages and jesters of little standing and experience, who on\\nthe most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of contrivance is needed,\\nlet the crumbs freeze on the way to their mouths, and know not which is\\ntheir right hand. I should like to go farther, and give reasons to show\\nthat it is advisable to choose those who are to hold so necessary an\\noffice in the state, but this is not the fit place for it; some day I\\nwill expound the matter to some one able to see to and rectify it; all I\\nsay now is, that the additional fact of his being a sorcerer has removed\\nthe sorrow it gave me to see these white hairs and this venerable\\ncountenance in so painful a position on account of his being a pimp;\\nthough I know well there are no sorceries in the world that can move or\\ncompel the will as some simple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is\\nthere herb or charm that can force it. All that certain silly women and\\nquacks do is to turn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that\\nthey have power to cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to\\ncompel the will.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is true,\" said the good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the\\ncharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\\ncannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\\nonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in peace\\nand quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions were\\nunavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back from,\\nwith this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that never gives\\nme a moment\\'s ease;\" and again he fell to weeping as before, and such\\ncompassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a real of four from\\nhis bosom and gave it to him in alms.',\n",
       " 'Don Quixote went on and asked another what his crime was, and the man\\nanswered with no less but rather much more sprightliness than the last\\none.',\n",
       " '\"I am here because I carried the joke too far with a couple of cousins of\\nmine, and with a couple of other cousins who were none of mine; in short,\\nI carried the joke so far with them all that it ended in such a\\ncomplicated increase of kindred that no accountant could make it clear:\\nit was all proved against me, I got no favour, I had no money, I was near\\nhaving my neck stretched, they sentenced me to the galleys for six years,\\nI accepted my fate, it is the punishment of my fault; I am a young man;\\nlet life only last, and with that all will come right. If you, sir, have\\nanything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it to you in heaven,\\nand we on earth will take care in our petitions to him to pray for the\\nlife and health of your worship, that they may be as long and as good as\\nyour amiable appearance deserves.\"',\n",
       " 'This one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he was\\na great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.',\n",
       " 'Behind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\\nexcept that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\\nother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on his\\nneck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\\n\"keep-friend\" or \"friend\\'s foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to\\nhis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were secured\\nby a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to his mouth\\nnor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this man carried\\nso many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was\\nbecause he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\\ntogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched\\nhim in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of\\nhis making his escape.',\n",
       " '\"What crimes can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have not\\ndeserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\"',\n",
       " '\"He goes for ten years,\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as\\ncivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\\nfamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\"',\n",
       " '\"Gently, senor commissary,\" said the galley slave at this, \"let us have\\nno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\\nfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his\\nown business, and he will be doing enough.\"',\n",
       " '\"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" replied\\nthe commissary, \"if you don\\'t want me to make you hold your tongue in\\nspite of your teeth.\"',\n",
       " '\"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \"that man goes as God\\npleases, but some one shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo\\nde Parapilla or not.\"',\n",
       " '\"Don\\'t they call you so, you liar?\" said the guard.',\n",
       " '\"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over calling me so,\\nor I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you, sir, have\\nanything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed you, for you\\nare becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about the lives of\\nothers; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I am Gines de\\nPasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\"',\n",
       " '\"He says true,\" said the commissary, \"for he has himself written his\\nstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in pawn\\nfor two hundred reals.\"',\n",
       " '\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for\\ntwo hundred ducats.\"',\n",
       " '\"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote.',\n",
       " '\"So good is it,\" replied Gines, \"that a fig for \\'Lazarillo de Tormes,\\'\\nand all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written compared\\nwith it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts, and facts\\nso neat and diverting that no lies could match them.\"',\n",

       " '\"The \\'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,\\'\" replied the subject of it.',\n",
