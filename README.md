## Project Description :

:new_moon: The aim :golf: of the project：
       
   * Design and implement an efficient data storage locker that utilizes deduplication.
             
   * Locker should be able to receive files and store them (for later retrieval) with a minimum storage by storing some common data blocks only once.
   
:waxing_crescent_moon: The project is based on    :**Python 3**

:first_quarter_moon: Our project will implement:

   * ASCII and Binary file storage and retrieve.
   
   * Retrieve all files stored in the locker in any order and at any time.
   
   * Graphic User Interface by package tkinter in python
   
   * File deletion without influncing other files.

## Instruction :laughing:

#### Prerequesite and installation :open_mouth:
* In order to run the code, **the OpenCV must be installed on your computer firstly**. 
  
* The team chose the **Windows 10** as the OS, **Visual Studio 2015** as the IDE and utilized the **C++** programming language.
  
* However, the choice of OS and IDE are subject to users, **the users could choose OS and IDE they preferred**.
  
* There are many tutorials available online for installing OpenCV on your computer, the user could find a suitable one and follow the instructions to install OpenCV on computers.

#### Run the code :relieved:
* After installing the OpenCV，the users could **download the modified code from our repository**.
  
* Then, add the code into your project. If the program need a input diagram, the users could download [**Lenna.png**](https://github.com/qinjinjia/ec601_ass1/blob/master/original.png) from our repository and add it into your project folder.
  

#### Enjoy the code and have fun!:wink::wink:
